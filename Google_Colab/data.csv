"As of February 2021[update], eleven vaccines are authorized by at least one national regulatory authority for public use: two RNA vaccines (the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine), four conventional inactivated vaccines (BBIBP-CorV, Covaxin, CoronaVac, and CoviVac), four viral vector vaccines (Sputnik V, the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, Convidicea, and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine), and one peptide vaccine (EpiVacCorona)."
Moderna targets producing 600 million doses and Convidicea 500 million doses in 2021.
"Prior to COVID‑19, a vaccine for an infectious disease had never been produced in less than several years—and no vaccine existed for preventing a coronavirus infection in humans."
Vaccines against SARS[12] and MERS[13] have been tested in non-human animals.
"According to studies published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world at that time."
"The rapid development and urgency of producing a vaccine for the COVID‑19 pandemic may increase the risks and failure rate of delivering a safe, effective vaccine."
"It comprises four pillars, each managed by two to three collaborating partners: Vaccines (also called ""COVAX""), Diagnostics, Therapeutics, and Health Systems Connector."
"The WHO vaccine coalition will prioritize which vaccines should go into Phase II and III clinical trials, and determine harmonized Phase III protocols for all vaccines achieving the pivotal trial stage."
"Canada announced funding for 96 research vaccine research projects at Canadian companies and universities, with plans to establish a ""vaccine bank"" that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs,[46] and to support clinical trials and develop manufacturing and supply chains for vaccines."
It encompassed every phase of development from research to manufacturing.
"Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates granted emergency marketing authorization for BBIBP-CorV, manufactured by Sinopharm."
"Messenger RNA contained in the vaccine enters cells and is translated into foreign proteins, which trigger an immune response."
"An RNA vaccine contains RNA which, when introduced into a tissue, acts as messenger RNA (mRNA) to cause the cells to build the foreign protein and stimulate an adaptive immune response which teaches the body how to identify and destroy the corresponding pathogen or cancer cells."
"RNA vaccines often, but not always, use nucleoside-modified messenger RNA."
The delivery of mRNA is achieved by a coformulation of the molecule into lipid nanoparticles which protect the RNA strands and help their absorption into the cells.
Vaccines in clinical trials include the Valneva COVID-19 vaccine.
"The antigens involved are often protein subunits, but can be any molecule that is a fragment of the pathogen."
Six of those have been approved for emergency or full use by at least one WHO-recognized stringent regulatory authorities.
"RNA vaccines  Pfizer–BioNTech  ModernaOverall efficacy was 70%, ranging from 62% to 90% with different dosing regimens, with a peer-reviewed safety profile."
An efficacy of 50% means that there are half as many cases of infection as in unvaccinated individuals.
"It is not straightforward to compare the efficacies of the different vaccines because the trials were run with different populations, geographies, and variants of the virus."
"Vaccine efficacy reflects disease prevention, a poor indicator of transmissibility of SARS‑CoV‑2 since asymptomatic people can be highly infectious."
The trial location also affects the reported efficacy because different countries have different prevalences of SARS-CoV-2 variants.
The ultimate goal of the study will be find whether the mix and match method is just as or more effective than the currently used practice.
"The study will utilize the shot developed by Pfizer and BioNTech with the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca shot, two vaccines which rely on different methods to deliver information to the cells of the recipient."
"Ugur Sahin has voiced his opposition to the trial in December, stating that a study ""will use up doses that people who need them could profit from, I am not happy about this,"" though Pfizer and AstraZeneca have supported the trials."
This is because T-cells target multiple pieces of the virus.
Viral vector and mRNA based vaccines are believed to elicit the strongest t-cell response.
"Companies including Emergex, Osivax and eTheRNA are targeting these internal antigens in the hope of creating a ""universal"" SARS-CoV-2 vaccine."

Question: What is the difference in liability between EU Conditional Marketing Authorisation vs Emergency Use Authorisations?.
Ms. Gallina stressed negotiations with companies had been difficult but underlined that those companies developing and manufacturing COVID-19 vaccines would indeed be liable according to current laws and if something goes wrong they could be taken to court.
This also goes for compensation for hidden defects.

modeled across countries how uncertainty about a vaccine's characteristics affects prioritization strategies for reducing deaths and transmission (see the Perspective by Fitzpatrick and Galvani).
"In the model, vaccine efficacy and its ability to reduce disease and/or block transmission was accounted for in relation to age-related variations in susceptibility, fatality rates, and immune decline."
"In almost all circumstances, reducing fatalities required distributing the vaccine to those who are most at risk of death, usually persons over 60 years of age and those with comorbidities."
"If a vaccine is leaky or poorly efficacious in older adults, then priority could be given to younger age groups."
"To increase the available doses, further priority should be given to seronegative individuals.Science, this issue p. 916; see also p. 890AbstractLimited initial supply of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine raises the question of how to prioritize available doses."
We used a mathematical model to compare five age-stratified prioritization strategies.
"A highly effective transmission-blocking vaccine prioritized to adults ages 20 to 49 years minimized cumulative incidence, but mortality and years of life lost were minimized in most scenarios when the vaccine was prioritized to adults greater than 60 years old."
Use of individual-level serological tests to redirect doses to seronegative individuals improved the marginal impact of each dose while potentially reducing existing inequities in COVID-19 impact.
"Although maximum impact prioritization strategies were broadly consistent across countries, transmission rates, vaccination rollout speeds, and estimates of naturally acquired immunity, this framework can be used to compare impacts of prioritization strategies across contexts.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a public health and economic crisis worldwide."
"As of January 2021, there have been more than 85 million cases and 1.8 million deaths reported (1)."
"To combat this crisis, a variety of nonpharmaceutical interventions have been implemented, including shelter-in-place orders, limited travel, and remote schooling."
"Although these efforts are essential to slowing transmission in the short term, long-term solutions—such as vaccines that protect from SARS-CoV-2 infection—remain urgently needed."
"The benefits of an effective vaccine for individuals and their communities have resulted in widespread demand, so it is critical that decision-making on vaccine distribution is well motivated, particularly in the initial phases when vaccine availability is limited (2).We used a model-informed approach to quantify the impact of COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies on cumulative incidence, mortality, and years of life lost."
Our approach explicitly addresses variation in three areas that can influence the outcome of vaccine distribution decisions.
"First, we considered variation in the performance of the vaccine, including its overall efficacy, a hypothetical decrease in efficacy by age, and the vaccine’s ability to block transmission."
"Second, we considered variation in both susceptibility to infection and the infection fatality rate by age."
"Third, we considered variation in the population and policy—including the age distribution, age-stratified contact rates, and initial fraction of seropositive individuals by age—and the speed and timing of the vaccine’s rollout relative to transmission."
"Although the earliest doses of vaccines will be given to front-line health care workers under plans such as those from the COVAX initiative and the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) recommendations (3), our work is focused on informing the prioritization of the doses that follow."
"On the basis of regulatory approvals and initial vaccine rollout speeds of early 2021, our investigation focuses generally on scenarios with a partially mitigated pandemic [reproduction number (R) between 1.1 and 2.0], vaccines with protective efficacy of 90%, and rollout speeds of 0.2% of the population per day.There are two main approaches to vaccine prioritization: (i) directly vaccinate those at highest risk for severe outcomes and (ii) protect them indirectly by vaccinating those who do the most transmitting."
"Model-based investigations of the trade-offs between these strategies for influenza vaccination have led to recommendations that children be vaccinated because of their critical role in transmission (4, 5) and have shown that direct protection is superior when reproduction numbers are high but indirect protection is superior when transmission is low (6)."
"Similar modeling for COVID-19 vaccination has found that the optimal balance between direct and indirect protection depends on both vaccine efficacy and supply, recommending direct vaccination of older adults for low-efficacy vaccines and for high-efficacy but supply-limited vaccines (7)."
"Rather than comparing prioritization strategies, others have compared hypothetical vaccines, showing that even those with lower efficacy for direct protection may be more valuable if they also provide better indirect protection by blocking transmission (8)."
"Prioritization of transmission-blocking vaccines can also be dynamically updated on the basis of the current state of the epidemic, shifting prioritization to avoid decreasing marginal returns (9)."
"These efforts to prioritize and optimize doses complement other work showing that under different vaccine efficacy and durability of immunity, the economic and health benefits of COVID-19 vaccines will be large in the short and medium terms (10)."
"The problem of vaccine prioritization also parallels the more general problem of optimal resource allocation to reduce transmission, such as with masks (11).Evaluation of vaccine prioritization strategiesWe evaluated the impact of vaccine prioritization strategies using an age-stratified SEIR model (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) because age has been shown to be an important correlate of susceptibility (12–14), seroprevalence (12, 15), severity (16–18), and mortality (19, 20)."
"This model includes an age-dependent contact matrix, susceptibility to infection, and infection fatality rate (IFR), allowing us to estimate cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, mortality due to infection, and years of life lost (YLL) (supplementary materials, materials and methods) by means of forward simulations of 1 year of disease dynamics."
"Cumulative incidence, mortality, and YLL were then used as outcomes by which to compare vaccine prioritization strategies."
These comparisons may be explored by using accompanying open-source and interactive calculation tools that accompany this study (21).We first examined the impact of five vaccine prioritization strategies for a hypothetical infection- and transmission-blocking vaccine of varying efficacy.
"The strategies prioritized vaccines to (i) children and teenagers, (ii) adults between ages 20 and 49 years, (iii) adults 20 years or older, (iv) adults 60 years or older, and (v) all individuals (Fig."
"In all strategies, once the prioritized population was vaccinated, vaccines were allocated irrespective of age—that is, in proportion to their numbers in the population."
"To incorporate vaccine hesitancy, at most 70% of any age group was eligible to be vaccinated (22)."

"These simulations assume contact patterns and demographics of the United States (38, 53) and an all-or-nothing, transmission-blocking vaccine with 90% vaccine efficacy and R0 = 1.5 (scenario 2) and R0 = 1.15 (scenario 1)."
"We measured reductions in cumulative incidence, mortality, and YLL achieved by each strategy, varying the vaccine supply between 1 and 50% of the total population, under two scenarios."
"In scenario 1, vaccines were administered to 0.2% of the population per day until supply was exhausted, with basic reproduction number (R0) = 1.15, representing highly mitigated spread during vaccine rollout."
"In scenario 2, vaccines were administered to 0.2% of the population per day until supply was exhausted, but with R0 = 1.5, representing substantial viral growth during vaccine rollout (example model outputs are provided in Fig."
"Results for additional scenarios in which vaccines were administered before transmission began are described in the supplementary materials, supplementary text, corresponding to countries without ongoing community spread such as South Korea and New Zealand."
"We considered two ways in which vaccine efficacy (ve) could be below 100%: an all-or-nothing vaccine, in which the vaccine provides perfect protection to a fraction ve of individuals who receive it, or as a leaky vaccine, in which all vaccinated individuals have reduced probability ve of infection after vaccination (supplementary materials, materials and methods).Of the five strategies, direct vaccination of adults older than 60 years of age (60+) always reduced mortality and YLL more than the alternative strategies when transmission was high [R0 = 1.5, scenario 2, 90% efficacy (Fig."
"For lower transmission (R0 = 1.15, scenario 1), vaccination of adults aged 20 to 49 years reduced mortality and YLL more than the alternative strategies, but differences between prioritization of adults aged 20 to 49 years, 20+ years, and 60+ years were small for vaccine supplies above 25% (Fig."
Prioritizing adults aged 20 to 49 years minimized cumulative incidence in both scenarios for all vaccine efficacies (Fig.
Prioritizing adults aged 20 to 49 years also minimized cumulative incidence in both scenarios under alternative rollout speeds (0.05 to 1% vaccinated per day) (fig.
"When rollout speeds were at least 0.3% per day and vaccine supply covered at least 25% of the population, the mortality-minimizing strategy shifted from prioritization of ages 20 to 49 years to adults aged 20+ or 60+ years for scenario 1; when rollout speeds were at least 0.75% per day and covered at least 24% of the population, the mortality-minimizing strategy shifted from prioritization of adults aged 60+ years to adults aged 20+ or 20 to 49 years for scenario 2 (fig."
Findings for mortality and YLL were only slightly changed by modeling vaccine efficacy as all or nothing (fig.
"S7).Impact of transmission rates, age demographics, and contact structureTo evaluate the impact of transmission rates on the strategy that most reduced mortality, we varied the basic reproductive number R0 from 1.1 to 2.0 when considering a hypothetical infection- and transmission-blocking vaccine with 90% vaccine efficacy."

"Download high-res imageTo determine whether our findings were robust across countries, we analyzed the ranking of prioritization strategies for populations with the age distributions and modeled contact structures of the United States, Belgium, Brazil, China, India, Poland, South Africa, and Spain."
"Across these countries, direct vaccination of adults aged 60+ years minimized mortality for all levels of vaccine supply when transmission was high (R0 = 1.5, scenario 2) (Fig."
Decreasing rollout speed from 0.2% to 0.1% per day caused prioritization of adults aged 60+ years to be favored in additional scenarios (Fig.
"Across countries, vaccination of adults aged 20 to 49 years nearly always minimized infections, and vaccination of adults aged 60+ years nearly always minimized YLL for scenario 2, but no clear ranking of strategies emerged consistently to minimize YLL in scenario 1 (fig."
S9).Vaccines with imperfect transmission-blocking effectsWe also considered whether the rankings of prioritization strategies to minimize mortality would change if a vaccine were to block COVID-19 symptoms and mortality with 90% efficacy but with variable impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission.
We found that direct vaccination of adults aged 60+ years minimized mortality for all vaccine supplies and transmission-blocking effects under scenario 2 and for all vaccine supplies when up to 50% of transmission was blocked in scenario 1 (supplementary text and fig.
"S10).Variation in vaccine efficacy by ageCOVID-19 vaccines may not be equally effective across age groups in preventing infection or disease, a phenomenon known to affect influenza vaccines (23–26)."
"To understand the impact of age-dependent COVID-19 vaccine efficacy, we incorporated a hypothetical linear decrease from a baseline efficacy of 90% for those younger than 60 years to 50% in those 80 years and older (Fig."
"As expected, this diminished the benefits of any prioritization strategy that included older adults."
"For example, strategies that prioritize adults aged 20 to 49 years were unaffected by decreased efficacy among adults aged 60+ years, whereas strategies prioritizing adults aged 60+ years were markedly diminished (Fig."
"Despite these effects, prioritization of adults aged 60+ years remained superior to the alternative strategies to minimize mortality in scenario 2."
"Download high-res imageBlack dots indicate break points at which prioritized demographic groups have been 70% vaccinated, after which vaccines are distributed without prioritization."
"Shown are contact patterns and demographics of the United States (38, 53); all-or-nothing and transmission-blocking vaccine."
"To test whether more substantial age-dependent vaccine effects would change which strategy minimized mortality in scenario 2, we varied the onset age of age-dependent decreases in efficacy, the extent to which it decreased, and the baseline efficacy from which it decreased."
"We found that as long as the age at which efficacy began to decrease was 70 years or older and vaccine efficacy among adults aged 80+ years was at least 25%, prioritizing adults aged 60+ years remained superior in the majority of parameter combinations."
"This finding was robust to whether the vaccine was modeled as leaky versus all or nothing, but we observed considerable variation from country to country (fig."
"S11).Incorporation of population seroprevalence and individual serological testingBecause of early indications that naturally acquired antibodies correlate with protection from reinfection (27), seroprevalence will affect vaccine prioritization in two ways."
"First, depending on the magnitude and age distribution of seroprevalence at the time of vaccine distribution, the ranking of strategies could change."
"Second, distributing vaccines to seropositive individuals would reduce the marginal benefit of vaccination per dose.To investigate the impact of vaccinating midepidemic while using serology to target the vaccine to seronegative individuals, we included age-stratified seroprevalence estimates in our model by moving the data-specified proportion of seropositive individuals from susceptible to recovered status."
We then simulated two approaches to vaccine distribution.
"In the first, vaccines were distributed according to the five prioritization strategies introduced above, regardless of any individual’s serostatus."
"In the second, vaccines were distributed with a serological test, so that individuals with a positive serological test would not be vaccinated, allowing their dose to be given to someone else in their age group.We included age-stratified seroprevalence estimates from New York City [August 2020; overall seroprevalence 26.9% (28)] and demographics and age-contact structure from the United States in evaluations of the previous five prioritization strategies."
"For this analysis, we focused on scenario 2 (0.2% rollout per day, R0 = 1.5 inclusive of seropositives) and found that the ranking of strategies to minimize incidence, mortality, and YLL remained unchanged: Prioritizing adults aged 60+ years most reduced mortality, and prioritizing adults aged 20 to 49 years most reduced incidence, regardless of whether vaccination was limited to seronegative individuals (Fig."
"These rankings were unchanged when we used lower or higher age-stratified seroprevalence estimates to test the consistency of results [Connecticut, July 2020, overall seroprevalence 3.4% (29) and synthetic, overall seroprevalence 39.5%] (figs."
"Despite lowered sensitivity to detect past exposure due to seroreversion (30, 31), preferentially vaccinating seronegative individuals yielded large additional reductions in cumulative incidence and mortality in locations with higher seroprevalence (Fig."
S13) and modest reductions in locations with low seroprevalence (fig.
"These results remained unchanged when statistical uncertainty, because of sample size and imperfect test sensitivity and specificity, was incorporated into the model (32)."
"Download high-res imagePlots show reductions for scenario 2 (0.2% rollout per day, R0 = 1.5) when vaccines are given to all individuals (solid lines) or to only seronegatives (dashed lines), inclusive of 96% serotest sensitivity, 99% specificity (54), and approximately 3 months of seroreversion (supplementary materials, materials and methods) (29)."
"Shown are U.S. contact patterns and demographics (38, 53), all-or-nothing and transmission-blocking vaccine with 90% vaccine efficacy."
Lower and higher seroprevalence examples are provided in figs.
DiscussionThis study demonstrated the use of an age-stratified modeling approach to evaluate and compare vaccine prioritization strategies for SARS-CoV-2.
"After accounting for country-specific age structure, age-contact structure, infection fatality rates, and seroprevalence, as well as the age-varying efficacy of a hypothetical vaccine, we found that across countries, those aged 60 years and older should be prioritized to minimize deaths, assuming a return to high contact rates and prepandemic behavior during or after vaccine rollout."
This recommendation is robust because of the dramatic differences in IFR by age.
Our model identified three general regimes in which prioritizing adults aged 20 to 49 years would provide greater mortality benefits than would prioritizing older adults.
One such regime was in the presence of substantial transmission-mitigating interventions (R0 = 1.15) and a vaccine with 80% or higher transmission-blocking effects.
A second regime was characterized by substantial transmission-mitigating interventions (R0 = 1.15) and either rollout speeds of at most 0.2% per day or vaccine supplies of at most 25% of the population.
"The third regime was characterized by vaccines with very low efficacy in older adults, very high efficacy in younger adults, and declines in efficacy starting at age 59 or 69 years."
The advantage of prioritizing all adults or adults aged 20 to 49 versus 60+ years was small under these conditions.
"Thus, we conclude that for mortality reduction, prioritization of older adults is a robust strategy that will be optimal or close to optimal to minimize mortality for virtually all plausible vaccine characteristics.By contrast, the ranking of infection-minimizing strategies for midepidemic vaccination led to consistent recommendations to prioritize adults aged 20 to 49 years across efficacy values and countries."
"For pretransmission vaccination, prioritization shifted toward children and teenagers for leaky vaccine efficacies 50% and below, which is in line with prior work (7), as well as for vaccines with weak transmission-blocking properties."
"Because a vaccine is likely to have properties of both leaky and all-or-nothing models, empirical data on vaccine performance could help resolve this difference in model recommendations, although data are difficult to obtain in practice [for example, (33, 34)].It is not yet clear whether the first generation of COVID-19 vaccines will be approved everywhere for the elderly or those under 18 years of age (35–37)."
"Although our conclusions assumed that the vaccine would be approved for all age groups, the evaluation approaches introduced here can be tailored to evaluate a subset of approaches restricted to those within the age groups for which a vaccine is licensed, by using open-source tools such as those that accompany this study."
"Furthermore, although we considered three possible goals of vaccination—minimizing cumulative incidence, mortality, or YLL—our framework can be adapted to consider goals such as minimizing hospitalizations, intensive care unit occupancy (7), or economic costs (10).We demonstrated that there is value in pairing individual-level serological tests with vaccination, even when accounting for the uncertainties in seroprevalence estimates (32) and seroreversion (30)."
"The marginal gain in effective vaccine supply, relative to no serological testing, must be weighed against the challenges of serological testing before vaccination."
"Serostatus itself is an imperfect indicator of protection, and the relationship of prior infection, serostatus, and protection may change over time (10, 27, 30, 31)."
"Delays in serological test results would impair vaccine distribution, but partial seronegative-targeting effects might be realized if those with past polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–confirmed infections voluntarily deprioritized their own vaccinations.The best-performing strategies depend on assumptions about the extent of a population’s interactions."
"We used prepandemic contact matrices (38), reflecting the goal of a return to prepandemic routines once a vaccine is available, but more recent estimates of age-stratified contact rates could be valuable in modeling midpandemic scenarios (39, 40)."
"Whether prepandemic or midpandemic contact estimates are representative of contact patterns during vaccine rollout remains unknown and may vary on the basis of numerous social, political, and other factors."
"The scenarios modeled here did not incorporate explicit nonpharmaceutical interventions, which might persist if vaccination coverage is incomplete, but are implicitly represented in scenario 1 (R0 = 1.15).Our study relies on estimates of other epidemiological parameters."
"In local contexts, these include age-structured seroprevalence and IFR, which vary by population (19, 20, 41)."
"Globally, key parameters include the degree to which antibodies protect against reinfection or severity of disease and relative infectiousness by age."
"From vaccine trials, we also need evidence of efficacy in groups vulnerable to severe outcomes, including the elderly."
"Additionally, it will be critical to measure whether a vaccine that protects against symptomatic disease also blocks infection and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (42).The role of children during this pandemic has been unclear."
"Under our assumptions about susceptibility by age, children are not the major drivers of transmission in communities, which is consistent with emerging evidence (12)."
"Thus, our results differ from the optimal distribution for influenza vaccines, which prioritize school-age children and adults aged 30 to 39 years (5)."
"However, the relative susceptibility and infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 by age remain uncertain."
"Although it is unlikely that susceptibility to infection conditional on exposure is constant across age groups (12), we ran our model to test the sensitivity of this parameter."
"Under the scenario of constant susceptibility by age, vaccinating those under 20 years of age has a greater impact on reducing cumulative cases than vaccinating those aged 20 to 49 years (figs."
S14 and 15).Our study is subject to a number of limitations.
"First, our evaluation strategy focuses on a single country at a time, rather than on between-population allocation (43)."
"Second, we only consider variation in disease severity by age."
"However, other factors correlate with disease outcomes, such as treatment and health care access and comorbidities, which may correlate with factors such as rural versus urban location, socioeconomic status, sex (44, 45), and race and ethnicity (46), which are not accounted for in this study."
"Inclusion of these factors in a model would be possible, but only with statistically sound measurements of their stratified infection risk, contact rates, and disease outcomes."
"Even in the case of age stratification, contact surveys have typically not surveyed those 80 years and older, yet it is this population that suffers dramatically more severe COVID-19 disease and higher infection fatality rates."
"We extrapolated contact matrices to those older than 80, but direct measurements would be superior."
"Last, our study focused on guiding strategy rather than providing more detailed forecasting or estimates (10)."
"As such, we have not made detailed parameter fits to time series of cases or deaths but rather have used epidemiologic models to identify robust strategies across a range of transmission scenarios.Our study also considers variation in disease risk only by age, through age-structured contact matrices and age-specific susceptibility, whereas many discussions around COVID-19 vaccine distribution have thus far focused on prioritizing health care or essential workers (47, 48)."
"Contact rates, and thus infection potential, vary greatly not only by occupation and age but also by living arrangement (such as congregate settings or dormitories), neighborhood and mobility (49–52), and whether the population has a coordinated and fundamentally effective policy to control the virus."
"With a better understanding of population structure during the pandemic, and risk factors of COVID-19, these limitations could be addressed."
"Meanwhile, the robust findings in favor of prioritizing those age groups with the highest IFR to minimize mortality could potentially be extended to prioritize those with comorbidities that predispose them to a high IFR because the strategy of prioritizing the older age groups depends on direct rather than indirect protection.Vaccine prioritization is not solely a question of science but a question of ethics as well."
"Hallmarks of the COVID-19 pandemic, as with other global diseases, are inequalities and disparities."
"Although these modeling efforts focus on age and minimizing incidence and death within a simply structured population, other considerations are crucial, from equity in allocation between countries to disparities in access to health care, including vaccination, that vary by neighborhood."
"Thus, the model’s simplistic representation of vulnerability (age) should be augmented by better information on the correlates of infection risk and severity."
Fair vaccine prioritization should avoid further harming disadvantaged populations.
"We suggest that after distribution, pairing serological testing with vaccination in the hardest-hit populations is one possible equitable way to extend the benefits of vaccination in settings where vaccination might otherwise not be deemed cost effective.Supplementary Materialsscience.sciencemag.org/content/371/6532/916/suppl/DC1Materials and MethodsSupplementary TextFigs."

"Saving Lives, Protecting PeopleWhen germs, such as the virus that causes COVID-19, invade our bodies, they attack and multiply."
"This invasion, called an infection, is what causes illness."
Our immune system uses several tools to fight infection.
"Blood contains red cells, which carry oxygen to tissues and organs, and white or immune cells, which fight infection."
Different types of white blood cells fight infection in different ways:The macrophages leave behind parts of the invading germs called antigens.
The body identifies antigens as dangerous and stimulates antibodies to attack them.
They produce antibodies that attack the pieces of the virus left behind by the macrophages.
T-lymphocytes are another type of defensive white blood cell.
They attack cells in the body that have already been infected.
"The first time a person is infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, it can take several days or weeks for their body to make and use all the germ-fighting tools needed to get over the infection."
"After the infection, the person’s immune system remembers what it learned about how to protect the body against that disease."
"The body keeps a few T-lymphocytes, called memory cells, that go into action quickly if the body encounters the same virus again."
"When the familiar antigens are detected, B-lymphocytes produce antibodies to attack them."
Experts are still learning how long these memory cells protect a person against the virus that causes COVID-19.
"How COVID-19 Vaccines WorkDifferent types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection, but with all types of vaccines, the body is left with a supply of “memory” T-lymphocytes as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus in the future."
It typically takes a few weeks for the body to produce T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes after vaccination.
"Therefore, it is possible that a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and then get sick because the vaccine did not have enough time to provide protection."
"Sometimes after vaccination, the process of building immunity can cause symptoms, such as fever."
These symptoms are normal and are a sign that the body is building immunity.
Types of VaccinesBelow is a description of how each type of vaccine prompts our bodies to recognize and protect us from the virus that causes COVID-19.
mRNA vaccines contain material from the virus that causes COVID-19 that gives our cells instructions for how to make a harmless protein that is unique to the virus.
"After our cells make copies of the protein, they destroy the genetic material from the vaccine."
Our bodies recognize that the protein should not be there and build T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight the virus that causes COVID-19 if we are infected in the future.
Protein subunit vaccines include harmless pieces (proteins) of the virus that cause COVID-19 instead of the entire germ.
"Once vaccinated, our immune system recognizes that the proteins don’t belong in the body and begins making T-lymphocytes and antibodies."
"If we are ever infected in the future, memory cells will recognize and fight the virus."
Vector vaccines contain a weakened version of a live virus—a different virus than the one that causes COVID-19—that has genetic material from the virus that causes COVID-19 inserted in it (this is called a viral vector).
"Once the viral vector is inside our cells, the genetic material gives cells instructions to make a protein that is unique to the virus that causes COVID-19."
"Using these instructions, our cells make copies of the protein."
This prompts our bodies to build T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus if we are infected in the future.
Most COVID-19 Vaccines Require More Than One ShotThe first shot starts building protection.
A second shot a few weeks later is needed to get the most protection the vaccine has to offer.
One vaccine in Phase 3 clinical trials only needs one shot.
"The Bottom LineProtection from COVID-19 is critically important because for some people, it can cause severe illness or death."
Stopping a pandemic requires using all the tools available.
Vaccines work with your immune system so your body will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed.
"Other steps, like masks and social distancing, help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others."
"Together, COVID-19 vaccination and following CDC’s recommendations to protect yourself and others will offer the best protection from COVID-19."

Who can get the COVID-19 vaccineMore centres are opening all the time.It's being given to:people aged 60 and overpeople at high risk from coronavirus (clinically extremely vulnerable)people who live or work in care homeshealth and social care workerspeople with a condition that puts them at higher risk (clinically vulnerable)people who are a main carer for someone at high risk from coronavirus
The NHS will let you know when it's your turn to have the vaccine.
It's important not to contact the NHS for a vaccination before then.
"Advice if you're of childbearing age, pregnant or breastfeedingBut more evidence is needed before you can routinely be offered it.The JCVI has updated its advice to recommend you may be able to have the vaccine if you're pregnant and:at high risk of getting coronavirus because of where you workhave a health condition that means you're at high risk of serious complications of coronavirusYou can have the COVID-19 vaccine if you're breastfeeding.Speak to a healthcare professional before you have the vaccination."
They will discuss the benefits and risks with you.You do not need to avoid pregnancy after vaccination.
"The vaccine cannot give you or your baby COVID-19.Read the latest COVID-19 vaccine advice if you're pregnant, may get pregnant or are breastfeeding on GOV.UKRead the latest Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and Royal College of Midwives statement on the COVID-19 vaccine and fertility"
You will have the 2nd dose 3 to 12 weeks after having the 1st dose.
The MHRA follows international standards of safety.Other vaccines are being developed.
"They will only be available on the NHS once they have been thoroughly tested to make sure they are safe and effective.So far, millions of people have been given a COVID-19 vaccine and reports of serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, have been very rare."

The 1st dose of the COVID-19 vaccine should give you good protection from coronavirus.
"But you need to have the 2 doses of the vaccine to give you longer lasting protection.There is a chance you might still get or spread coronavirus even if you have the vaccine.This means it is important to:continue to follow social distancing guidanceif you can, wear something that covers your nose and mouth in places where it's hard to stay away from other people"
"COVID-19 vaccine side effectsIf you do have a reaction to the vaccine, it usually happens in minutes."
Staff giving the vaccine are trained to deal with allergic reactions and treat them immediately.
Spring 2021 is the best estimate of when vaccines will be available for the general public.
Do not show up at a hub or provider looking for a vaccine.
Call only if the website doesn’t answer your questions.
Do you know someone who is eligible for a vaccine but doesn’t have internet access?Please let them know they can call 2‑1‑1 for referral to a local vaccine provider.
"Vaccine supply is still limited in Texas, but more arrives each week."
Important to KnowIt’s best if you get your second dose from the same brand as your first dose.
"For example, if you got a Moderna first dose, it’s best to get Moderna for your second dose."
The timing between your first and second dose depends on which vaccine you received:The chance of a severe reaction is less than 0.5%.
"To be safe, your provider will have you wait on-site for 15-30 minutes after your shot."
V-safe: Register with CDC's V-safe After Vaccination Health Checker on your smartphone to report any side effects after getting the COVID-19 vaccine.
You’ll also get reminders for your second vaccine dose.
"Texas Vaccine Rollout TimelineSpring 2021 is the best estimate of when vaccine will be available for the general public, but that may change."
