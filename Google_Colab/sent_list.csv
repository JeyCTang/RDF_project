modeled across countries how uncertainty about a vaccine is characteristics affects prioritization strategies for reducing deaths and transmission (see the Perspective by Fitzpatrick and Galvani)
In the model vaccine efficacy and its ability to reduce disease and  or block transmission was accounted for in relation to age-related variations in susceptibility fatality rates and immune decline
In almost all circumstances reducing fatalities required distributing the vaccine to those who are most at risk of death usually persons over 60 years of age and those with comorbidities
If a vaccine is leaky or poorly efficacious in older adults then priority could be given to younger age groups
To increase the available doses further priority should be given to seronegative individualsScience this issue p 916  see also p 890AbstractLimited initial supply of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine raises the question of how to prioritize available doses
We used a mathematical model to compare five age-stratified prioritization strategies
A highly effective transmission-blocking vaccine prioritized to adults ages 20 to 49 years minimized cumulative incidence but mortality and years of life lost were minimized in most scenarios when the vaccine was prioritized to adults greater than 60 years old
Use of individual-level serological tests to redirect doses to seronegative individuals improved the marginal impact of each dose while potentially reducing existing inequities in COVID-19 impact
Although maximum impact prioritization strategies were broadly consistent across countries transmission rates vaccination rollout speeds and estimates of naturally acquired immunity this framework can be used to compare impacts of prioritization strategies across contextsSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a public health and economic crisis worldwide
As of January 2021 there have been more than 85 million cases and 18 million deaths reported (1)
To combat this crisis a variety of nonpharmaceutical interventions have been implemented including shelter-in-place orders limited travel and remote schooling
Although these efforts are essential to slowing transmission in the short term long-term solutions—such as vaccines that protect from SARS-CoV-2 infection—remain urgently needed
The benefits of an effective vaccine for individuals and their communities have resulted in widespread demand so it is critical that decision-making on vaccine distribution is well motivated particularly in the initial phases when vaccine availability is limited (2)We used a model-informed approach to quantify the impact of COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies on cumulative incidence mortality and years of life lost
Our approach explicitly addresses variation in three areas that can influence the outcome of vaccine distribution decisions
First we considered variation in the performance of the vaccine including its overall efficacy a hypothetical decrease in efficacy by age and the vaccine is ability to block transmission
Second we considered variation in both susceptibility to infection and the infection fatality rate by age
Third we considered variation in the population and policy—including the age distribution age-stratified contact rates and initial fraction of seropositive individuals by age—and the speed and timing of the vaccine is rollout relative to transmission
Although the earliest doses of vaccines will be given to front-line health care workers under plans such as those from the COVAX initiative and the US National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) recommendations (3) our work is focused on informing the prioritization of the doses that follow
Model-based investigations of the trade-offs between these strategies for influenza vaccination have led to recommendations that children be vaccinated because of their critical role in transmission (4 5) and have shown that direct protection is superior when reproduction numbers are high but indirect protection is superior when transmission is low (6)
Similar modeling for COVID-19 vaccination has found that the optimal balance between direct and indirect protection depends on both vaccine efficacy and supply recommending direct vaccination of older adults for low-efficacy vaccines and for high-efficacy but supply-limited vaccines (7)
Rather than comparing prioritization strategies others have compared hypothetical vaccines showing that even those with lower efficacy for direct protection may be more valuable if they also provide better indirect protection by blocking transmission (8)
Prioritization of transmission-blocking vaccines can also be dynamically updated on the basis of the current state of the epidemic shifting prioritization to avoid decreasing marginal returns (9)
These efforts to prioritize and optimize doses complement other work showing that under different vaccine efficacy and durability of immunity the economic and health benefits of COVID-19 vaccines will be large in the short and medium terms (10)
The problem of vaccine prioritization also parallels the more general problem of optimal resource allocation to reduce transmission such as with masks (11)Evaluation of vaccine prioritization strategiesWe evaluated the impact of vaccine prioritization strategies using an age-stratified SEIR model (susceptible exposed infectious recovered) because age has been shown to be an important correlate of susceptibility (12–14) seroprevalence (12 15) severity (16–18) and mortality (19 20)
This model includes an age-dependent contact matrix susceptibility to infection and infection fatality rate (IFR) allowing us to estimate cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections mortality due to infection and years of life lost (YLL) (supplementary materials materials and methods) by means of forward simulations of 1 year of disease dynamics
Cumulative incidence mortality and YLL were then used as outcomes by which to compare vaccine prioritization strategies
These comparisons may be explored by using accompanying open-source and interactive calculation tools that accompany this study (21)We first examined the impact of five vaccine prioritization strategies for a hypothetical infection- and transmission-blocking vaccine of varying efficacy
The strategies prioritized vaccines to (i) children and teenagers (ii) adults between ages 20 and 49 years (iii) adults 20 years or older (iv) adults 60 years or older and (v) all individuals (Fig
In all strategies once the prioritized population was vaccinated vaccines were allocated irrespective of age—that is in proportion to their numbers in the population
To incorporate vaccine hesitancy at most 70% of any age group was eligible to be vaccinated (22)

These simulations assume contact patterns and demographics of the United States (38 53) and an all-or-nothing transmission-blocking vaccine with 90% vaccine efficacy and R0 = 15 (scenario 2) and R0 = 115 (scenario 1)
We measured reductions in cumulative incidence mortality and YLL achieved by each strategy varying the vaccine supply between 1 and 50% of the total population under two scenarios
In scenario 2 vaccines were administered to 02% of the population per day until supply was exhausted but with R0 = 15 representing substantial viral growth during vaccine rollout (example model outputs are provided in Fig
Results for additional scenarios in which vaccines were administered before transmission began are described in the supplementary materials supplementary text corresponding to countries without ongoing community spread such as South Korea and New Zealand
We considered two ways in which vaccine efficacy (ve) could be below 100%  an all-or-nothing vaccine in which the vaccine provides perfect protection to a fraction ve of individuals who receive it or as a leaky vaccine in which all vaccinated individuals have reduced probability ve of infection after vaccination (supplementary materials materials and methods)Of the five strategies direct vaccination of adults older than 60 years of age (60+) always reduced mortality and YLL more than the alternative strategies when transmission was high [R0 = 15 scenario 2 90% efficacy (Fig
When rollout speeds were at least 03% per day and vaccine supply covered at least 25% of the population the mortality-minimizing strategy shifted from prioritization of ages 20 to 49 years to adults aged 20+ or 60+ years for scenario 1  when rollout speeds were at least 075% per day and covered at least 24% of the population the mortality-minimizing strategy shifted from prioritization of adults aged 60+ years to adults aged 20+ or 20 to 49 years for scenario 2 (fig
Findings for mortality and YLL were only slightly changed by modeling vaccine efficacy as all or nothing (fig
We found that prioritizing adults aged 60+ years remained the best way to reduce mortality and YLL for R0 ≥ 13 but prioritizing adults aged 20 to 49 years was superior for R0 ≤ 12 (Fig
S8)To evaluate the impact of transmission rates on the strategy that most reduced mortality we varied the basic reproductive number R0 from 11 to 20 when considering a hypothetical infection- and transmission-blocking vaccine with 90% vaccine efficacy

S10)Variation in vaccine efficacy by ageCOVID-19 vaccines may not be equally effective across age groups in preventing infection or disease a phenomenon known to affect influenza vaccines (23–26)
To understand the impact of age-dependent COVID-19 vaccine efficacy we incorporated a hypothetical linear decrease from a baseline efficacy of 90% for those younger than 60 years to 50% in those 80 years and older (Fig
As expected this diminished the benefits of any prioritization strategy that included older adults
Download high-res imageBlack dots indicate break points at which prioritized demographic groups have been 70% vaccinated after which vaccines are distributed without prioritization
Shown are contact patterns and demographics of the United States (38 53)  all-or-nothing and transmission-blocking vaccine
To test whether more substantial age-dependent vaccine effects would change which strategy minimized mortality in scenario 2 we varied the onset age of age-dependent decreases in efficacy the extent to which it decreased and the baseline efficacy from which it decreased
We found that as long as the age at which efficacy began to decrease was 70 years or older and vaccine efficacy among adults aged 80+ years was at least 25% prioritizing adults aged 60+ years remained superior in the majority of parameter combinations
S11)Incorporation of population seroprevalence and individual serological testingBecause of early indications that naturally acquired antibodies correlate with protection from reinfection (27) seroprevalence will affect vaccine prioritization in two ways
First depending on the magnitude and age distribution of seroprevalence at the time of vaccine distribution the ranking of strategies could change
Second distributing vaccines to seropositive individuals would reduce the marginal benefit of vaccination per doseTo investigate the impact of vaccinating midepidemic while using serology to target the vaccine to seronegative individuals we included age-stratified seroprevalence estimates in our model by moving the data-specified proportion of seropositive individuals from susceptible to recovered status
We then simulated two approaches to vaccine distribution
In the first vaccines were distributed according to the five prioritization strategies introduced above regardless of any individual is serostatus
For this analysis we focused on scenario 2 (02% rollout per day R0 = 15 inclusive of seropositives) and found that the ranking of strategies to minimize incidence mortality and YLL remained unchanged  Prioritizing adults aged 60+ years most reduced mortality and prioritizing adults aged 20 to 49 years most reduced incidence regardless of whether vaccination was limited to seronegative individuals (Fig
These rankings were unchanged when we used lower or higher age-stratified seroprevalence estimates to test the consistency of results [Connecticut July 2020 overall seroprevalence 34% (29) and synthetic overall seroprevalence 395%] (figs
Despite lowered sensitivity to detect past exposure due to seroreversion (30 31) preferentially vaccinating seronegative individuals yielded large additional reductions in cumulative incidence and mortality in locations with higher seroprevalence (Fig
These results remained unchanged when statistical uncertainty because of sample size and imperfect test sensitivity and specificity was incorporated into the model (32)
Shown are US contact patterns and demographics (38 53) all-or-nothing and transmission-blocking vaccine with 90% vaccine efficacy
Lower and higher seroprevalence examples are provided in figs
DiscussionThis study demonstrated the use of an age-stratified modeling approach to evaluate and compare vaccine prioritization strategies for SARS-CoV-2
After accounting for country-specific age structure age-contact structure infection fatality rates and seroprevalence as well as the age-varying efficacy of a hypothetical vaccine we found that across countries those aged 60 years and older should be prioritized to minimize deaths assuming a return to high contact rates and prepandemic behavior during or after vaccine rollout
This recommendation is robust because of the dramatic differences in IFR by age
Our model identified three general regimes in which prioritizing adults aged 20 to 49 years would provide greater mortality benefits than would prioritizing older adults
One such regime was in the presence of substantial transmission-mitigating interventions (R0 = 115) and a vaccine with 80% or higher transmission-blocking effects
A second regime was characterized by substantial transmission-mitigating interventions (R0 = 115) and either rollout speeds of at most 02% per day or vaccine supplies of at most 25% of the population
The third regime was characterized by vaccines with very low efficacy in older adults very high efficacy in younger adults and declines in efficacy starting at age 59 or 69 years
For pretransmission vaccination prioritization shifted toward children and teenagers for leaky vaccine efficacies 50% and below which is in line with prior work (7) as well as for vaccines with weak transmission-blocking properties
Because a vaccine is likely to have properties of both leaky and all-or-nothing models empirical data on vaccine performance could help resolve this difference in model recommendations although data are difficult to obtain in practice [for example (33 34)]It is not yet clear whether the first generation of COVID-19 vaccines will be approved everywhere for the elderly or those under 18 years of age (35–37)
Although our conclusions assumed that the vaccine would be approved for all age groups the evaluation approaches introduced here can be tailored to evaluate a subset of approaches restricted to those within the age groups for which a vaccine is licensed by using open-source tools such as those that accompany this study
Furthermore although we considered three possible goals of vaccination—minimizing cumulative incidence mortality or YLL—our framework can be adapted to consider goals such as minimizing hospitalizations intensive care unit occupancy (7) or economic costs (10)We demonstrated that there is value in pairing individual-level serological tests with vaccination even when accounting for the uncertainties in seroprevalence estimates (32) and seroreversion (30)
The marginal gain in effective vaccine supply relative to no serological testing must be weighed against the challenges of serological testing before vaccination
Serostatus itself is an imperfect indicator of protection and the relationship of prior infection serostatus and protection may change over time (10 27 30 31)
Delays in serological test results would impair vaccine distribution but partial seronegative-targeting effects might be realized if those with past polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–confirmed infections voluntarily deprioritized their own vaccinationsThe best-performing strategies depend on assumptions about the extent of a population is interactions
We used prepandemic contact matrices (38) reflecting the goal of a return to prepandemic routines once a vaccine is available but more recent estimates of age-stratified contact rates could be valuable in modeling midpandemic scenarios (39 40)
Whether prepandemic or midpandemic contact estimates are representative of contact patterns during vaccine rollout remains unknown and may vary on the basis of numerous social political and other factors
The scenarios modeled here did not incorporate explicit nonpharmaceutical interventions which might persist if vaccination coverage is incomplete but are implicitly represented in scenario 1 (R0 = 115)Our study relies on estimates of other epidemiological parameters
In local contexts these include age-structured seroprevalence and IFR which vary by population (19 20 41)
Globally key parameters include the degree to which antibodies protect against reinfection or severity of disease and relative infectiousness by age
From vaccine trials we also need evidence of efficacy in groups vulnerable to severe outcomes including the elderly
Under our assumptions about susceptibility by age children are not the major drivers of transmission in communities which is consistent with emerging evidence (12)
However the relative susceptibility and infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 by age remain uncertain
Although it is unlikely that susceptibility to infection conditional on exposure is constant across age groups (12) we ran our model to test the sensitivity of this parameter
Under the scenario of constant susceptibility by age vaccinating those under 20 years of age has a greater impact on reducing cumulative cases than vaccinating those aged 20 to 49 years (figs
First our evaluation strategy focuses on a single country at a time rather than on between-population allocation (43)
Second we only consider variation in disease severity by age
However other factors correlate with disease outcomes such as treatment and health care access and comorbidities which may correlate with factors such as rural versus urban location socioeconomic status sex (44 45) and race and ethnicity (46) which are not accounted for in this study
Inclusion of these factors in a model would be possible but only with statistically sound measurements of their stratified infection risk contact rates and disease outcomes
Even in the case of age stratification contact surveys have typically not surveyed those 80 years and older yet it is this population that suffers dramatically more severe COVID-19 disease and higher infection fatality rates
We extrapolated contact matrices to those older than 80 but direct measurements would be superior
Last our study focused on guiding strategy rather than providing more detailed forecasting or estimates (10)
As such we have not made detailed parameter fits to time series of cases or deaths but rather have used epidemiologic models to identify robust strategies across a range of transmission scenariosOur study also considers variation in disease risk only by age through age-structured contact matrices and age-specific susceptibility whereas many discussions around COVID-19 vaccine distribution have thus far focused on prioritizing health care or essential workers (47 48)
Contact rates and thus infection potential vary greatly not only by occupation and age but also by living arrangement (such as congregate settings or dormitories) neighborhood and mobility (49–52) and whether the population has a coordinated and fundamentally effective policy to control the virus
With a better understanding of population structure during the pandemic and risk factors of COVID-19 these limitations could be addressed
Meanwhile the robust findings in favor of prioritizing those age groups with the highest IFR to minimize mortality could potentially be extended to prioritize those with comorbidities that predispose them to a high IFR because the strategy of prioritizing the older age groups depends on direct rather than indirect protectionVaccine prioritization is not solely a question of science but a question of ethics as well
Hallmarks of the COVID-19 pandemic as with other global diseases are inequalities and disparities
Although these modeling efforts focus on age and minimizing incidence and death within a simply structured population other considerations are crucial from equity in allocation between countries to disparities in access to health care including vaccination that vary by neighborhood
Thus the model is simplistic representation of vulnerability (age) should be augmented by better information on the correlates of infection risk and severity
Fair vaccine prioritization should avoid further harming disadvantaged populations
We suggest that after distribution pairing serological testing with vaccination in the hardest-hit populations is one possible equitable way to extend the benefits of vaccination in settings where vaccination might otherwise not be deemed cost effectiveSupplementary Materialssciencesciencemagorg  content  371  6532  916  suppl  DC1Materials and MethodsSupplementary TextFigs

Saving Lives Protecting PeopleWhen germs such as the virus that causes COVID-19 invade our bodies they attack and multiply
This invasion called an infection is what causes illness
Our immune system uses several tools to fight infection
Blood contains red cells which carry oxygen to tissues and organs and white or immune cells which fight infection
Different types of white blood cells fight infection in different ways The macrophages leave behind parts of the invading germs called antigens
The body identifies antigens as dangerous and stimulates antibodies to attack them
They produce antibodies that attack the pieces of the virus left behind by the macrophages
T-lymphocytes are another type of defensive white blood cell
They attack cells in the body that have already been infected
The first time a person is infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 it can take several days or weeks for their body to make and use all the germ-fighting tools needed to get over the infection
After the infection the person is immune system remembers what it learned about how to protect the body against that disease
The body keeps a few T-lymphocytes called memory cells that go into action quickly if the body encounters the same virus again
Experts are still learning how long these memory cells protect a person against the virus that causes COVID-19
How COVID-19 Vaccines WorkDifferent types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection but with all types of vaccines the body is left with a supply of  memory  T-lymphocytes as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus in the future
It typically takes a few weeks for the body to produce T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes after vaccination
Therefore it is possible that a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and then get sick because the vaccine did not have enough time to provide protection
Sometimes after vaccination the process of building immunity can cause symptoms such as fever
These symptoms are normal and are a sign that the body is building immunity
Types of VaccinesBelow is a description of how each type of vaccine prompts our bodies to recognize and protect us from the virus that causes COVID-19
mRNA vaccines contain material from the virus that causes COVID-19 that gives our cells instructions for how to make a harmless protein that is unique to the virus
After our cells make copies of the protein they destroy the genetic material from the vaccine
Our bodies recognize that the protein should not be there and build T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight the virus that causes COVID-19 if we are infected in the future
Protein subunit vaccines include harmless pieces (proteins) of the virus that cause COVID-19 instead of the entire germ
Once vaccinated our immune system recognizes that the proteins do not belong in the body and begins making T-lymphocytes and antibodies
If we are ever infected in the future memory cells will recognize and fight the virus
Vector vaccines contain a weakened version of a live virus—a different virus than the one that causes COVID-19—that has genetic material from the virus that causes COVID-19 inserted in it (this is called a viral vector)
Once the viral vector is inside our cells the genetic material gives cells instructions to make a protein that is unique to the virus that causes COVID-19
Using these instructions our cells make copies of the protein
This prompts our bodies to build T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus if we are infected in the future
Most COVID-19 Vaccines Require More Than One ShotThe first shot starts building protection
A second shot a few weeks later is needed to get the most protection the vaccine has to offer
One vaccine in Phase 3 clinical trials only needs one shot
The Bottom LineProtection from COVID-19 is critically important because for some people it can cause severe illness or death
Stopping a pandemic requires using all the tools available
Vaccines work with your immune system so your body will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed
Other steps like masks and social distancing help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others
Together COVID-19 vaccination and following CDC is recommendations to protect yourself and others will offer the best protection from COVID-19
