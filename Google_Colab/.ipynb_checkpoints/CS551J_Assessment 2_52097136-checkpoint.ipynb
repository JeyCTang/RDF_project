      "A COVID‚Äë19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2), the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‚Äë19). Prior to the COVID‚Äë19 pandemic, there was established body of knowledge about the structure and function of coronaviruses causing diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which enabled accelerated development of various vaccine technologies during early 2020.[1] On 10 January 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence data was shared through GISAID, and by 19 March, the global pharmaceutical industry announced a major commitment to address COVID-19.[2]\n",
      "As of February¬†2021[update], 66 vaccine candidates are in clinical research, including 17 in Phase I trials, 23 in Phase I‚ÄìII trials, 6 in Phase II trials, and 20 in Phase III trials.[3] Trials for four other candidates were terminated.[3] In Phase III trials, several COVID‚Äë19 vaccines demonstrate efficacy as high as 95% in preventing symptomatic COVID‚Äë19 infections. As of February¬†2021[update], eleven vaccines are authorized by at least one national regulatory authority for public use: two RNA vaccines (the Pfizer‚ÄìBioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine), four conventional inactivated vaccines (BBIBP-CorV, Covaxin, CoronaVac, and CoviVac), four viral vector vaccines (Sputnik V, the Oxford‚ÄìAstraZeneca vaccine, Convidicea, and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine), and one peptide vaccine (EpiVacCorona).[3]\n",
      "Many countries have implemented phased distribution plans that prioritize those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.[4] As of 3¬†March¬†2021[update], 275.84¬†million doses of COVID‚Äë19 vaccine have been administered worldwide based on official reports from national health agencies.[5] AstraZeneca-Oxford anticipates producing 3 billion doses in 2021, Pfizer-BioNTech 1.3 billion doses, and Sputnik V, Sinopharm, Sinovac, and Johnson & Johnson 1 billion doses each. Moderna targets producing 600 million doses and Convidicea 500 million doses in 2021.[6][7] By December 2020, more than 10¬†billion vaccine doses had been preordered by countries,[8] with about half of the doses purchased by high-income countries comprising 14% of the world's population.[9]\n",

      " A US airman receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.\n",
      "Prior to COVID‚Äë19, a vaccine for an infectious disease had never been produced in less than several years‚Äîand no vaccine existed for preventing a coronavirus infection in humans.[10] However, vaccines have been produced against several animal diseases caused by coronaviruses, including (as of 2003) infectious bronchitis virus in birds, canine coronavirus, and feline coronavirus.[11] Previous projects to develop vaccines for viruses in the family Coronaviridae that affect humans have been aimed at severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Vaccines against SARS[12] and MERS[13] have been tested in non-human animals.\n",
      "According to studies published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world at that time.[14][15][16] As of 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine proven to be safe and effective against SARS in humans.[17][18]  There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.[19] When MERS became prevalent, it was believed that existing SARS research may provide a useful template for developing vaccines and therapeutics against a MERS-CoV infection.[17][20] As of March 2020, there was one (DNA based) MERS vaccine which completed Phase¬†I clinical trials in humans[21] and three others in progress, all being viral-vectored vaccines: two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).[22]\n",
      "The urgency to create a vaccine for COVID‚Äë19, led to compressed schedules that shortened the standard vaccine development timeline, in some cases combining clinical trial steps over months, a process typically conducted sequentially over years.[23] Multiple steps along the entire development path are evaluated, including the level of acceptable toxicity of the vaccine (its safety), targeting vulnerable populations, the need for vaccine efficacy breakthroughs, the duration of vaccination protection, special delivery systems (such as oral or nasal, rather than by injection), dose regimen, stability and storage characteristics, emergency use authorization before formal licensing, optimal manufacturing for scaling to billions of doses, and dissemination of the licensed vaccine.[10][24] Timelines for conducting clinical research¬†‚Äì normally a sequential process requiring years¬†‚Äì are being compressed into safety, efficacy, and dosing trials running simultaneously over months, potentially compromising safety assurance.[23][25] As an example, Chinese vaccine developers and the government Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention began their efforts in January 2020,[26] and by March were pursuing numerous candidates on short timelines, with the goal to showcase Chinese technology strengths over those of the United States, and to reassure the Chinese people about the quality of vaccines produced in China.[23][27]\n",
      "\n",
      "Planning and development\n",
      "Since early 2020, vaccine development has been expedited via unprecedented collaboration in the multinational pharmaceutical industry and between governments.[28] According to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the geographic distribution of COVID‚Äë19 vaccine development puts North American entities having about 40% of the activity compared to 30% in Asia and Australia, 26% in Europe, and a few projects in South America and Africa.[28][29]\n",
      "There have been several unique challenges with COVID-19 vaccine development.  The rapid development and urgency of producing a vaccine for the COVID‚Äë19 pandemic may increase the risks and failure rate of delivering a safe, effective vaccine.[29][30][31]  Additionally, research at universities is obstructed by physical distancing and closing of laboratories.[32][33]\n",
      "Vaccines must progress through several phases of clinical trials to test for safety, immunogenicity, effectiveness, dose levels and adverse effects of the candidate vaccine.[34][35]  Vaccine developers have to invest resources internationally to find enough participants for Phase¬†II‚ÄìIII clinical trials when the virus has proved to be a \"moving target\" of changing transmission rate across and within countries, forcing companies to compete for trial participants;[36] clinical trial organizers may encounter people unwilling to be vaccinated due to vaccine hesitancy[37] or disbelieving the science of the vaccine technology and its ability to prevent infection.[38]  Even as new vaccines are developed during the COVID‚Äë19 pandemic, licensure of COVID‚Äë19 vaccine candidates requires submission of a full dossier of information on development and manufacturing quality.[39][40][41]\n",
      "\n",
      "Organizations\n",
      "Internationally, the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator is a G20 and World Health Organization (WHO) initiative announced in April 2020.[42][43] It is a cross-discipline support structure to enable partners to share resources and knowledge. It comprises four pillars, each managed by two to three collaborating partners: Vaccines (also called \"COVAX\"), Diagnostics, Therapeutics, and Health Systems Connector.[44]  The WHO's April 2020 \"R&D Blueprint (for the) novel Coronavirus\" documented a \"large, international, multi-site, individually randomized controlled clinical trial\" to allow \"the concurrent evaluation of the benefits and risks of each promising candidate vaccine within 3‚Äì6 months of it being made available for the trial.\"  The WHO vaccine coalition will prioritize which vaccines should go into Phase II and III clinical trials, and determine harmonized Phase¬†III protocols for all vaccines achieving the pivotal trial stage.[45]\n",
      "National governments have also been involved in vaccine development. Canada announced funding for 96 research vaccine research projects at Canadian companies and universities, with plans to establish a \"vaccine bank\" that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs,[46] and to support clinical trials and develop manufacturing and supply chains for vaccines.[47] China provided low-rate loans to a vaccine developer through its central bank and \"quickly made land available for the company\" to build production plants.[25]  Three Chinese vaccine companies and research institutes are supported by the government for financing research, conducting clinical trials, and manufacturing.[48]  Great Britain formed a COVID‚Äë19 vaccine task force in April 2020 to stimulate local efforts for accelerated development of a vaccine through collaborations of industry, universities, and government agencies. It encompassed every phase of development from research to manufacturing.[49]  In the United States, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a federal agency funding disease-fighting technology, announced investments to support American COVID‚Äë19 vaccine development and manufacture of the most promising candidates.[25][50]  In May 2020, the government announced funding for a fast-track program called Operation Warp Speed.[51][52]\n",
      "Large pharmaceutical companies with experience in making vaccines at scale, including Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), formed alliances with biotechnology companies, governments, and universities to accelerate progression to an effective vaccine.[25][23]\n",

      " COVID‚Äë19 vaccine research samples in NIAID lab freezer. (30 January 2020)\n",
      "After a coronavirus was isolated in December 2019,[53] its genetic sequence was published on 11 January 2020, triggering an urgent international response to prepare for an outbreak and hasten development of a preventive COVID-19 vaccine.[54][55][56] Since early 2020, vaccine development has been expedited via unprecedented collaboration in the multinational pharmaceutical industry and between governments.[57] By June 2020, tens of billions of dollars were invested by corporations, governments, international health organizations, and university research groups to develop dozens of vaccine candidates and prepare for global vaccination programs to immunize against COVID‚Äë19 infection.[55][58][59][60]  According to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the geographic distribution of COVID‚Äë19 vaccine development puts North American entities having about 40% of the activity compared to 30% in Asia and Australia, 26% in Europe, and a few projects in South America and Africa.[54][57]\n",
      "In February 2020, the WHO said it did not expect a vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2), the causative virus, to become available in less than 18 months.[61] The rapidly growing infection rate of COVID‚Äë19 worldwide during early 2020 stimulated international alliances and government efforts to urgently organize resources to make multiple vaccines on shortened timelines,[62] with four vaccine candidates entering human evaluation in March (see the table of clinical trials started in 2020, below).[54][63]\n",
      "On 24 June 2020, China approved the CanSino vaccine for limited use in the military and two inactivated virus vaccines for emergency use in high-risk occupations.[64] On 11 August 2020, Russia announced the approval of its Sputnik V vaccine for emergency use, though one month later only small amounts of the vaccine had been distributed for use outside of the phase 3 trial.[65]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pfizer-BioNTech partnership submitted an EUA request to the FDA for the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (active ingredient tozinameran) on 20 November 2020.[66][67] On 2 December 2020, the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) gave temporary regulatory approval for the Pfizer‚ÄìBioNTech vaccine,[68][69] becoming the first country to approve this vaccine and the first country in the Western world to approve the use of any COVID‚Äë19 vaccine.[70][71][72] As of 21 December, many countries and the European Union[73] have authorized or approved the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID‚Äë19 vaccine. Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates granted emergency marketing authorization for BBIBP-CorV, manufactured by Sinopharm.[74][75] On 11 December 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID‚Äë19 vaccine.[76] A week later, they granted an EUA for mRNA-1273, the Moderna vaccine.[77][78][79]\n",
      "Vaccine types\n",
      " Conceptual diagram showing three vaccine types for forming SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2 proteins to prompt an immune response: (1) RNA vaccine, (2) subunit vaccine, (3) viral vector vaccine\n",
      "As of January 2021, nine different technology platforms¬†‚Äì with the technology of numerous candidates remaining undefined¬†‚Äì are under research and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID‚Äë19.[3][80] Most of the platforms of vaccine candidates in clinical trials are focused on the coronavirus spike protein and its variants as the primary antigen of COVID‚Äë19 infection.[80] Platforms being developed in 2020 involved nucleic acid technologies (nucleoside-modified messenger RNA and DNA), non-replicating viral vectors, peptides, recombinant proteins, live attenuated viruses, and inactivated viruses.[10][80][29][30]\n",
      "Many vaccine technologies being developed for COVID‚Äë19 are not like vaccines already in use to prevent influenza, but rather are using \"next-generation\" strategies for precision on COVID‚Äë19 infection mechanisms.[80][29][30] Vaccine platforms in development may improve flexibility for antigen manipulation and effectiveness for targeting mechanisms of COVID‚Äë19 infection in susceptible population subgroups, such as healthcare workers, the elderly, children, pregnant women, and people with existing weakened immune systems.[80][29]\n",
      "\n",
      "RNA vaccines\n",
      " Diagram of the operation of an RNA vaccine.  Messenger RNA contained in the vaccine enters cells and is translated into foreign proteins, which trigger an immune response.\n",
      "An RNA vaccine contains RNA which, when introduced into a tissue, acts as messenger RNA (mRNA) to cause the cells to build the foreign protein and stimulate an adaptive immune response which teaches the body how to identify and destroy the corresponding pathogen or cancer cells.  RNA vaccines often, but not always, use nucleoside-modified messenger RNA.  The delivery of mRNA is achieved by a coformulation of the molecule into lipid nanoparticles which protect the RNA strands and help their absorption into the cells.[81][82][83][84]\n",
      "RNA vaccines were the first COVID-19 vaccines to be authorized in the United States and the European Union.[85][86] As of January 2021[update], authorized vaccines of this type are the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID‚Äë19 vaccine[87][88][89] and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.[90][91] As of February 2021[update], the CVnCoV RNA vaccine from CureVac is awaiting authorization in the EU.[92]\n",
      "\n",
      "Adenovirus vector vaccines\n",
      "These vaccines are examples of non-replicating viral vectors, using an adenovirus shell containing DNA that encodes a SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2 protein.[93] The viral vector-based vaccines against COVID-19 are non-replicating, meaning that they do not make new virus particles, but rather produce only the antigen which elicits a systemic immune response.[93]\n",
      "As of January 2021, authorized vaccines of this type are the British Oxford‚ÄìAstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine,[94][95][96] Russian Sputnik V,[97] Chinese Convidicea, and the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.[98][99]\n",
      "Convidicia and Johnson & Johnson's vaccine's are both one-shot vaccines which offer less complicated logistics; and can be stored under ordinary refrigeration for several months.[100][101]\n",
      "\n",
      "Inactivated virus vaccines\n",
      "Inactivated vaccines consist of virus particles that have been grown in culture and then are killed using a method such as heat or formaldehyde to lose disease producing capacity, while still stimulating an immune response.[102]\n",
      "As of January 2021, authorized vaccines of this type are the Chinese CoronaVac[103][104][105] and BBIBP-CorV[106] as well as the Indian Covaxin.  Vaccines in clinical trials include the Valneva COVID-19 vaccine.[107][108]\n",
      "\n",
      "Subunit vaccines\n",
      "Subunit vaccines present one or more antigens without introducing whole pathogen particles. The antigens involved are often protein subunits, but can be any molecule that is a fragment of the pathogen.[109]\n",
      "As of January 2021, the only authorized vaccine of this type is the peptide vaccine EpiVacCorona.[110]  Vaccines in clinical trials include the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine[111] and RBD-Dimer.[3]  The V451 vaccine was previously in clinical trials, which were terminated because it was found that the vaccine may potentially cause incorrect results for subsequent HIV testing.[112][113]\n",
      "\n",
      "Other types\n",
      "Additional types of vaccines that are in clinical trials include multiple DNA plasmid vaccines,[114][115][116][117][118][119] at least two lentivirus vector vaccines,[120][121] a conjugate vaccine, and a vesicular stomatitis virus displaying the SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2 spike protein.[122]\n",
      "Scientists investigated whether existing vaccines for unrelated conditions could prime the immune system and lessen the severity of COVID‚Äë19 infection.[123] There is experimental evidence that the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis has non-specific effects on the immune system, but no evidence that this vaccine is effective against COVID‚Äë19.[124]\n",
      "\n",
      "Trial and authorization status\n",
      "Phase¬†I trials test primarily for safety and preliminary dosing in a few dozen healthy subjects, while Phase¬†II trials¬†‚Äì following success in Phase¬†I¬†‚Äì evaluate immunogenicity, dose levels (efficacy based on biomarkers) and adverse effects of the candidate vaccine, typically in hundreds of people.[34][35] A Phase¬†I‚ÄìII trial consists of preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing, is typically randomized, placebo-controlled, while determining more precise, effective doses.[35] Phase¬†III trials typically involve more participants at multiple sites, include a control group, and test effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease (an \"interventional\" or \"pivotal\" trial), while monitoring for adverse effects at the optimal dose.[34][35] Definition of vaccine safety, efficacy, and clinical endpoints in a Phase¬†III trial may vary between the trials of different companies, such as defining the degree of side effects, infection or amount of transmission, and whether the vaccine prevents moderate or severe COVID‚Äë19 infection.[36][125][126]\n",
      "A clinical trial design in progress may be modified as an \"adaptive design\" if accumulating data in the trial provide early insights about positive or negative efficacy of the treatment.[127][128]  Adaptive designs within ongoing Phase¬†II‚ÄìIII clinical trials on candidate vaccines may shorten trial durations and use fewer subjects, possibly expediting decisions for early termination or success, avoiding duplication of research efforts, and enhancing coordination of design changes for the Solidarity trial across its international locations.[127][129]\n",

Vaccine efficacy reflects disease prevention, a poor indicator of transmissibility of SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2 since asymptomatic people can be highly infectious.[455] The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) set a cutoff of 50% as the efficacy required to approve a COVID‚Äë19 vaccine.[456][457]\n",

      "At the University of Oxford, researchers have as of early February 2021 begun enrolling volunteers in an 820 person trial to evaluate the efficacy of combining two different vaccines, a mix and match approach, as opposed to using two doses of the same vaccine. The ultimate goal of the study will be find whether the mix and match method is just as or more effective than the currently used practice. The study will utilize the shot developed by Pfizer and BioNTech with the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca shot, two vaccines which rely on different methods to deliver information to the cells of the recipient. Ugur Sahin has voiced his opposition to the trial in December, stating that a study \"will use up doses that people who need them could profit from, I am not happy about this,\" though Pfizer and AstraZeneca have supported the trials.[470]\n",

      "A preliminary study by Pfizer, Inc. has indicated that there is, at most, only minor reduction of the company's mRNA vaccine effectiveness against different SARS-CoV-2 variants.[471]  According to the US CDC, most experts believe that, due to the nature of the virus, the emergence of variants that completely escape the immune response (both natural and vaccine induced) is considered unlikely.[99]\n",
      "T-cell immunity is under investigation as a potential solution to the problem of reduced effectiveness of vaccines against the relevant variants. This is because T-cells target multiple pieces of the virus.[472] As the majority of genetic variation is on the spike protein, T-cells that attack other parts of the virus should be able to recognise new variants. Viral vector and mRNA based vaccines are believed to elicit the strongest t-cell response.[473] This believed to be the reason why the vaccine developed for yellow fever, an RNA virus like SARS-CoV-2, has remained effective for so long; by targeting antigens within the virus that are unlikely to change, as opposed to those on the surface, it is unaffected by the majority of mutations. Companies including Emergex, Osivax and eTheRNA are targeting these internal antigens in the hope of creating a \"universal\" SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.[474] Biotechnology firm Gritstone is also experimenting to develop a vaccine aimed specifically at creating T-cell immunity.[475][476]\n",
      "On 29 January 2021, a deputy of the Moscow City Duma, Darya Besedina, turned to the Russian Minister of Health with a request to fund the study of new strains and conduct research on the effectiveness of Russian vaccines against these strains.[477] On 10 February 2021, the European Medicines Agency made a similar appeal to vaccine manufacturers.[478] On 15 February, Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the government to deploy the sequencing of the genomes of Russian SARS-CoV-2 strains within a month, allocate funds for these studies, and also check whether Russian vaccines are effective against new strains.[479]\n",

They have launched a trial of a new vaccine to tackle the South African 501.V2 variant (also known as B.1.351).[485] On 17 February 2021, Pfizer announced neutralization activity was reduced by two thirds for the 501.V2 variant, while stating no claims about the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing illness for this variant could yet be made.[486]\n",
      "In January, Johnson & Johnson, which held trials for its Ad26.COV2.S vaccine in South Africa, reported the level of protection against moderate to severe COVID-19 infection was 72% in the United States and 57% in South Africa.[487]\n",
      "On 6 February 2021, the Financial Times reported that provisional trial data from a study undertaken by South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand in conjunction with Oxford University demonstrated reduced efficacy of the Oxford‚ÄìAstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine against the 501.V2 variant.[488] The study found that in a sample size of 2,000 the AZD1222 vaccine afforded only \"minimal protection\" in all but the most severe cases of COVID-19.[489] On 7 February 2021, the Minister for Health for South Africa suspended the planned deployment of around 1 million doses of the vaccine whilst they examine the data and await advice on how to proceed.[490][491]\n",

      "Formulation\n",
      "As of September¬†2020[update], eleven of the vaccine candidates in clinical development use adjuvants to enhance immunogenicity.[80] An immunological adjuvant is a substance formulated with a vaccine to elevate the immune response to an antigen, such as the COVID‚Äë19 virus or influenza virus.[492] Specifically, an adjuvant may be used in formulating a COVID‚Äë19 vaccine candidate to boost its immunogenicity and efficacy to reduce or prevent COVID‚Äë19 infection in vaccinated individuals.[492][493] Adjuvants used in COVID‚Äë19 vaccine formulation may be particularly effective for technologies using the inactivated COVID‚Äë19 virus and recombinant protein-based or vector-based vaccines.[493] Aluminum salts, known as \"alum\", were the first adjuvant used for licensed vaccines, and are the adjuvant of choice in some 80% of adjuvanted vaccines.[493] The alum adjuvant initiates diverse molecular and cellular mechanisms to enhance immunogenicity, including release of proinflammatory cytokines.[492][493]\n",

      "As of 3 March 2021, 275.84¬†million COVID‚Äë19 vaccine doses had been administered worldwide based on official reports from national health agencies collated by Our World in Data.[496]\n",
      "During a pandemic on the rapid timeline and scale of COVID‚Äë19 infections during 2020, international organizations like the WHO and CEPI, vaccine developers, governments, and industry are evaluating the distribution of the eventual vaccine(s).[497] Individual countries producing a vaccine may be persuaded to favor the highest bidder for manufacturing or provide first-service to their own country.[498][499][500][501] Experts emphasize that licensed vaccines should be available and affordable for people at the frontline of healthcare and having the greatest need.[498][499][501] In April, it was reported that the UK agreed to work with 20 other countries and global organizations including France, Germany and Italy to find a vaccine and to share the results and that UK citizens would not get preferential access to any new COVID‚Äë19 vaccines developed by taxpayer-funded UK universities.[502] Several companies plan to initially manufacture a vaccine at artificially low pricing, then increase prices for profitability later if annual vaccinations are needed and as countries build stock for future needs.[501]\n",
      "\n",
      "An April 2020 CEPI report stated: \"Strong international coordination and cooperation between vaccine developers, regulators, policymakers, funders, public health bodies, and governments will be needed to ensure that promising late-stage vaccine candidates can be manufactured in sufficient quantities and equitably supplied to all affected areas, particularly low-resource regions.\"[503] The WHO and CEPI are developing financial resources and guidelines for global deployment of several safe, effective COVID‚Äë19 vaccines, recognizing the need is different across countries and population segments.[497][504][505][506]  For example, successful COVID‚Äë19 vaccines would likely be allocated first to healthcare personnel and populations at greatest risk of severe illness and death from COVID‚Äë19 infection, such as the elderly or densely-populated impoverished people.[507][508] The WHO, CEPI, and GAVI have expressed concerns that affluent countries should not receive priority access to the global supply of eventual COVID‚Äë19 vaccines, but rather protecting healthcare personnel and people at high risk of infection are needed to address public health concerns and reduce economic impact of the pandemic.[503][505][507]\n",

      "On 4 February 2020, US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar published a notice of declaration under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act for medical countermeasures against COVID‚Äë19, covering \"any vaccine, used to treat, diagnose, cure, prevent, or mitigate COVID‚Äë19, or the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or a virus mutating therefrom\", and stating that the declaration precludes \"liability claims alleging negligence by a manufacturer in creating a vaccine, or negligence by a health care provider in prescribing the wrong dose, absent willful misconduct\".[509] The declaration is effective in the United States through 1 October 2024.[509]\n",
      "In the European Union, the COVID‚Äë19 vaccines are licensed under a Conditional Marketing Authorisation which does not exempt manufacturers from civil and administrative liability claims.[510] While the purchasing contracts with vaccine manufacturers remain secret, they do not contain liability exemptions even for side-effects not known at the time of licensure.[511]\n",
      "\n",
      "Society and culture\n",
      "Access\n",
      "Nations pledged to buy doses of COVID-19 vaccine before the doses were available. Though high-income nations represent only 14% of the global population, as of 15 November 2020, they had contracted to buy 51% of all pre-sold doses. Some high-income nations bought more doses than would be necessary to vaccinate their entire populations.[512]\n",
      "On 18 January 2021, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned of problems with equitable distribution: \"More than 39 million doses of vaccine have now been administered in at least 49 higher-income countries. Just 25 doses have been given in one lowest-income country. Not 25 million; not 25 thousand; just 25.\"[513]\n",
      "The Chinese Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccine was authorized for emergency use by Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates in December 2020.[514][515]\n",
      "Some nations involved in long-standing territorial disputes have reportedly had their access to vaccines blocked by competing nations; Palestine has accused Israel blocking vaccine delivery to Gaza, while Taiwan has suggested that China has hampered its efforts to procure vaccine doses.[516][517][518]\n",
      "A single dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by AstraZeneca would cost 47 Egyptian pounds (EGP) and the authorities are selling it between 100-200 EGP. A report by Carnegie Endowment for International Peace cited the current poverty rate in Egypt as around 29.7 percent, which constitutes approximately 30.5 million people, and claimed that about 15 million of the Egyptians would be unable to gain access to the luxury of vaccination. A human rights lawyer, Khaled Ali launched a lawsuit against the government, forcing them to provide vaccination free of cost to all members of the public.[519]\n",
      "According to the immunologist Anthony Fauci, mutant strains of virus and limited vaccine distribution pose continuing risks and he said: \"we have to get the entire world vaccinated, not just our own country.\"[520] Edward Bergmark and Arick Wierson are calling for an global vaccination effort and wrote that the wealthier nations' \"me-first\" mentality could ultimately backfire, because the spread of the virus in poorer countries would lead to more variants, against which current vaccines could be less effective.[521]\n",

      "Anti-vaccination activists and other people spread a variety of rumors, including overblown claims about side effects, a story about COVID-19 being spread by childhood vaccines, misrepresentations about how the immune system works, and when and how COVID-19 vaccines are made.\n",
      "Vaccine hesitancy\n",
      "Some 10% of the public perceives vaccines as unsafe or unnecessary, refusing vaccination¬†‚Äì a global health threat called vaccine hesitancy[522]¬†‚Äì which increases the risk of further viral spread that could lead to COVID‚Äë19 outbreaks.[37] In mid-2020, estimates from two surveys were that 67% or 80% of people in the U.S. would accept a new vaccination against COVID‚Äë19, with wide disparity by education level, employment status, race, and geography.[523]\n",
      "A poll conducted by National Geographic and Morning Consult demonstrated a gender gap on willingness to take a COVID‚Äë19 vaccine in the U.S., with 69% of men polled saying they would take the vaccine, compared to only 51% of women. The poll also showed a positive correlation between education level and willingness to take the vaccine.[524]\n",
      "In an effort to demonstrate the vaccine's safety, prominent politicians have received it on camera, with others pledging to do so.[525][526][527]\n",

[The] WHO is working to ensure that all of them have the chance of being tested at the initial stage of development.

To increase the chances of success (given the high level of attrition during vaccine development), we must test all candidate vaccines until they fail. [The] WHO is working to ensure that all of them have the chance of being tested at the initial stage of development. The results for the efficacy of each vaccine are expected within three to six months and this evidence, combined with data on safety, will inform decisions about whether it can be used on a wider scale.\n",

      "Vaccine prioritizationThere is likely to be high demand for the limited supplies of vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), so how should vaccine distribution be prioritized? Bubar et al. modeled across countries how uncertainty about a vaccine's characteristics affects prioritization strategies for reducing deaths and transmission (see the Perspective by Fitzpatrick and Galvani). In the model, vaccine efficacy and its ability to reduce disease and/or block transmission was accounted for in relation to age-related variations in susceptibility, fatality rates, and immune decline. In almost all circumstances, reducing fatalities required distributing the vaccine to those who are most at risk of death, usually persons over 60 years of age and those with comorbidities. If a vaccine is leaky or poorly efficacious in older adults, then priority could be given to younger age groups. To increase the available doses, further priority should be given to seronegative individuals.Science, this issue p. 916; see also p. 890AbstractLimited initial supply of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine raises the question of how to prioritize available doses. We used a mathematical model to compare five age-stratified prioritization strategies. A highly effective transmission-blocking vaccine prioritized to adults ages 20 to 49 years minimized cumulative incidence, but mortality and years of life lost were minimized in most scenarios when the vaccine was prioritized to adults greater than 60 years old. Use of individual-level serological tests to redirect doses to seronegative individuals improved the marginal impact of each dose while potentially reducing existing inequities in COVID-19 impact. Although maximum impact prioritization strategies were broadly consistent across countries, transmission rates, vaccination rollout speeds, and estimates of naturally acquired immunity, this framework can be used to compare impacts of prioritization strategies across contexts.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a public health and economic crisis worldwide. As of January 2021, there have been more than 85 million cases and 1.8 million deaths reported (1). To combat this crisis, a variety of nonpharmaceutical interventions have been implemented, including shelter-in-place orders, limited travel, and remote schooling. Although these efforts are essential to slowing transmission in the short term, long-term solutions‚Äîsuch as vaccines that protect from SARS-CoV-2 infection‚Äîremain urgently needed. The benefits of an effective vaccine for individuals and their communities have resulted in widespread demand, so it is critical that decision-making on vaccine distribution is well motivated, particularly in the initial phases when vaccine availability is limited (2).We used a model-informed approach to quantify the impact of COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies on cumulative incidence, mortality, and years of life lost. Our approach explicitly addresses variation in three areas that can influence the outcome of vaccine distribution decisions. First, we considered variation in the performance of the vaccine, including its overall efficacy, a hypothetical decrease in efficacy by age, and the vaccine‚Äôs ability to block transmission. Second, we considered variation in both susceptibility to infection and the infection fatality rate by age. Third, we considered variation in the population and policy‚Äîincluding the age distribution, age-stratified contact rates, and initial fraction of seropositive individuals by age‚Äîand the speed and timing of the vaccine‚Äôs rollout relative to transmission. Although the earliest doses of vaccines will be given to front-line health care workers under plans such as those from the COVAX initiative and the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) recommendations (3), our work is focused on informing the prioritization of the doses that follow. On the basis of regulatory approvals and initial vaccine rollout speeds of early 2021, our investigation focuses generally on scenarios with a partially mitigated pandemic [reproduction number (R) between 1.1 and 2.0], vaccines with protective efficacy of 90%, and rollout speeds of 0.2% of the population per day.There are two main approaches to vaccine prioritization: (i) directly vaccinate those at highest risk for severe outcomes and (ii) protect them indirectly by vaccinating those who do the most transmitting. Model-based investigations of the trade-offs between these strategies for influenza vaccination have led to recommendations that children be vaccinated because of their critical role in transmission (4, 5) and have shown that direct protection is superior when reproduction numbers are high but indirect protection is superior when transmission is low (6). Similar modeling for COVID-19 vaccination has found that the optimal balance between direct and indirect protection depends on both vaccine efficacy and supply, recommending direct vaccination of older adults for low-efficacy vaccines and for high-efficacy but supply-limited vaccines (7). Rather than comparing prioritization strategies, others have compared hypothetical vaccines, showing that even those with lower efficacy for direct protection may be more valuable if they also provide better indirect protection by blocking transmission (8). Prioritization of transmission-blocking vaccines can also be dynamically updated on the basis of the current state of the epidemic, shifting prioritization to avoid decreasing marginal returns (9). These efforts to prioritize and optimize doses complement other work showing that under different vaccine efficacy and durability of immunity, the economic and health benefits of COVID-19 vaccines will be large in the short and medium terms (10). The problem of vaccine prioritization also parallels the more general problem of optimal resource allocation to reduce transmission, such as with masks (11).Evaluation of vaccine prioritization strategiesWe evaluated the impact of vaccine prioritization strategies using an age-stratified SEIR model (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) because age has been shown to be an important correlate of susceptibility (12‚Äì14), seroprevalence (12, 15), severity (16‚Äì18), and mortality (19, 20). This model includes an age-dependent contact matrix, susceptibility to infection, and infection fatality rate (IFR), allowing us to estimate cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, mortality due to infection, and years of life lost (YLL) (supplementary materials, materials and methods) by means of forward simulations of 1 year of disease dynamics. Cumulative incidence, mortality, and YLL were then used as outcomes by which to compare vaccine prioritization strategies. These comparisons may be explored by using accompanying open-source and interactive calculation tools that accompany this study (21).We first examined the impact of five vaccine prioritization strategies for a hypothetical infection- and transmission-blocking vaccine of varying efficacy. The strategies prioritized vaccines to (i) children and teenagers, (ii) adults between ages 20 and 49 years, (iii) adults 20 years or older, (iv) adults 60 years or older, and (v) all individuals (Fig. 1A). In all strategies, once the prioritized population was vaccinated, vaccines were allocated irrespective of age‚Äîthat is, in proportion to their numbers in the population. To incorporate vaccine hesitancy, at most 70% of any age group was eligible to be vaccinated (22).\n",

      "We measured reductions in cumulative incidence, mortality, and YLL achieved by each strategy, varying the vaccine supply between 1 and 50% of the total population, under two scenarios. In scenario 1, vaccines were administered to 0.2% of the population per day until supply was exhausted, with basic reproduction number (R0) = 1.15, representing highly mitigated spread during vaccine rollout. In scenario 2, vaccines were administered to 0.2% of the population per day until supply was exhausted, but with R0 = 1.5, representing substantial viral growth during vaccine rollout (example model outputs are provided in Fig. 1). Results for additional scenarios in which vaccines were administered before transmission began are described in the supplementary materials, supplementary text, corresponding to countries without ongoing community spread such as South Korea and New Zealand. We considered two ways in which vaccine efficacy (ve) could be below 100%: an all-or-nothing vaccine, in which the vaccine provides perfect protection to a fraction ve of individuals who receive it, or as a leaky vaccine, in which all vaccinated individuals have reduced probability ve of infection after vaccination (supplementary materials, materials and methods).Of the five strategies, direct vaccination of adults older than 60 years of age (60+) always reduced mortality and YLL more than the alternative strategies when transmission was high [R0 = 1.5, scenario 2, 90% efficacy (Fig. 1); 30 to 100% efficacy (fig. S5)]. For lower transmission (R0 = 1.15, scenario 1), vaccination of adults aged 20 to 49 years reduced mortality and YLL more than the alternative strategies, but differences between prioritization of adults aged 20 to 49 years, 20+ years, and 60+ years were small for vaccine supplies above 25% (Fig. 1 and fig. S5). Prioritizing adults aged 20 to 49 years minimized cumulative incidence in both scenarios for all vaccine efficacies (Fig. 1 and fig. S5). Prioritizing adults aged 20 to 49 years also minimized cumulative incidence in both scenarios under alternative rollout speeds (0.05 to 1% vaccinated per day) (fig. S6). When rollout speeds were at least 0.3% per day and vaccine supply covered at least 25% of the population, the mortality-minimizing strategy shifted from prioritization of ages 20 to 49 years to adults aged 20+ or 60+ years for scenario 1; when rollout speeds were at least 0.75% per day and covered at least 24% of the population, the mortality-minimizing strategy shifted from prioritization of adults aged 60+ years to adults aged 20+ or 20 to 49 years for scenario 2 (fig. S6). Findings for mortality and YLL were only slightly changed by modeling vaccine efficacy as all or nothing (fig. S5) or leaky (fig. S7).Impact of transmission rates, age demographics, and contact structureTo evaluate the impact of transmission rates on the strategy that most reduced mortality, we varied the basic reproductive number R0 from 1.1 to 2.0 when considering a hypothetical infection- and transmission-blocking vaccine with 90% vaccine efficacy. We found that prioritizing adults aged 60+ years remained the best way to reduce mortality and YLL for R0 ‚â• 1.3, but prioritizing adults aged 20 to 49 years was superior for R0 ‚â§ 1.2 (Fig. 2, A and B, and fig. S8). Prioritizing adults aged 20 to 49 years minimized infections for all values of R0 investigated (fig.

      "To determine whether our findings were robust across countries, we analyzed the ranking of prioritization strategies for populations with the age distributions and modeled contact structures of the United States, Belgium, Brazil, China, India, Poland, South Africa, and Spain. Across these countries, direct vaccination of adults aged 60+ years minimized mortality for all levels of vaccine supply when transmission was high (R0 = 1.5, scenario 2) (Fig. 2E) but in only some cases when transmission was lower (R0 = 1.15, rollout 0.2% per day, scenario 1) (Fig. 2D). Decreasing rollout speed from 0.2% to 0.1% per day caused prioritization of adults aged 60+ years to be favored in additional scenarios (Fig. 2C). Across countries, vaccination of adults aged 20 to 49 years nearly always minimized infections, and vaccination of adults aged 60+ years nearly always minimized YLL for scenario 2, but no clear ranking of strategies emerged consistently to minimize YLL in scenario 1 (fig. S9).Vaccines with imperfect transmission-blocking effectsWe also considered whether the rankings of prioritization strategies to minimize mortality would change if a vaccine were to block COVID-19 symptoms and mortality with 90% efficacy but with variable impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. We found that direct vaccination of adults aged 60+ years minimized mortality for all vaccine supplies and transmission-blocking effects under scenario 2 and for all vaccine supplies when up to 50% of transmission was blocked in scenario 1 (supplementary text and fig. S10).Variation in vaccine efficacy by ageCOVID-19 vaccines may not be equally effective across age groups in preventing infection or disease, a phenomenon known to affect influenza vaccines (23‚Äì26). To understand the impact of age-dependent COVID-19 vaccine efficacy, we incorporated a hypothetical linear decrease from a baseline efficacy of 90% for those younger than 60 years to 50% in those 80 years and older (Fig. 3). As expected, this diminished the benefits of any prioritization strategy that included older adults. For example, strategies that prioritize adults aged 20 to 49 years were unaffected by decreased efficacy among adults aged 60+ years, whereas strategies prioritizing adults aged 60+ years were markedly diminished (Fig. 3). Despite these effects, prioritization of adults aged 60+ years remained superior to the alternative strategies to minimize mortality in scenario 2.\n",

      "Fig. 3 Effects of age-dependent vaccine efficacy on the impacts of prioritization strategies.(A) Diagram of hypothetical age-dependent vaccine efficacy shows decrease from 90% baseline efficacy to 50% efficacy among individuals aged 80+ years, beginning at age 60 (dashed line). (B and C) Percent reduction in deaths in comparison with an unmitigated outbreak for transmission-blocking all-or-nothing vaccines with either constant 90% efficacy for all age groups (solid lines) or age-dependent efficacy shown in (A) (dashed lines), covering scenario 1 [0.2% rollout per day, R0 = 1.15; (B)] and scenario 2 [0.2% rollout per day, R0 = 1.5 (C)]. Black dots indicate break points at which prioritized demographic groups have been 70% vaccinated, after which vaccines are distributed without prioritization. Shown are contact patterns and demographics of the United States (38, 53); all-or-nothing and transmission-blocking vaccine. \n",
      "To test whether more substantial age-dependent vaccine effects would change which strategy minimized mortality in scenario 2, we varied the onset age of age-dependent decreases in efficacy, the extent to which it decreased, and the baseline efficacy from which it decreased. We found that as long as the age at which efficacy began to decrease was 70 years or older and vaccine efficacy among adults aged 80+ years was at least 25%, prioritizing adults aged 60+ years remained superior in the majority of parameter combinations. This finding was robust to whether the vaccine was modeled as leaky versus all or nothing, but we observed considerable variation from country to country (fig. S11).Incorporation of population seroprevalence and individual serological testingBecause of early indications that naturally acquired antibodies correlate with protection from reinfection (27), seroprevalence will affect vaccine prioritization in two ways. First, depending on the magnitude and age distribution of seroprevalence at the time of vaccine distribution, the ranking of strategies could change. Second, distributing vaccines to seropositive individuals would reduce the marginal benefit of vaccination per dose.To investigate the impact of vaccinating midepidemic while using serology to target the vaccine to seronegative individuals, we included age-stratified seroprevalence estimates in our model by moving the data-specified proportion of seropositive individuals from susceptible to recovered status. We then simulated two approaches to vaccine distribution. In the first, vaccines were distributed according to the five prioritization strategies introduced above, regardless of any individual‚Äôs serostatus. In the second, vaccines were distributed with a serological test, so that individuals with a positive serological test would not be vaccinated, allowing their dose to be given to someone else in their age group.We included age-stratified seroprevalence estimates from New York City [August 2020; overall seroprevalence 26.9% (28)] and demographics and age-contact structure from the United States in evaluations of the previous five prioritization strategies. For this analysis, we focused on scenario 2 (0.2% rollout per day, R0 = 1.5 inclusive of seropositives) and found that the ranking of strategies to minimize incidence, mortality, and YLL remained unchanged: Prioritizing adults aged 60+ years most reduced mortality, and prioritizing adults aged 20 to 49 years most reduced incidence, regardless of whether vaccination was limited to seronegative individuals (Fig. 4). These rankings were unchanged when we used lower or higher age-stratified seroprevalence estimates to test the consistency of results [Connecticut, July 2020, overall seroprevalence 3.4% (29) and synthetic, overall seroprevalence 39.5%] (figs. S12 and S13). Despite lowered sensitivity to detect past exposure due to seroreversion (30, 31), preferentially vaccinating seronegative individuals yielded large additional reductions in cumulative incidence and mortality in locations with higher seroprevalence (Fig. 4 and fig. S13) and modest reductions in locations with low seroprevalence (fig. S12). These results remained unchanged when statistical uncertainty, because of sample size and imperfect test sensitivity and specificity, was incorporated into the model (32).\n",

      "DiscussionThis study demonstrated the use of an age-stratified modeling approach to evaluate and compare vaccine prioritization strategies for SARS-CoV-2. After accounting for country-specific age structure, age-contact structure, infection fatality rates, and seroprevalence, as well as the age-varying efficacy of a hypothetical vaccine, we found that across countries, those aged 60 years and older should be prioritized to minimize deaths, assuming a return to high contact rates and prepandemic behavior during or after vaccine rollout. This recommendation is robust because of the dramatic differences in IFR by age. Our model identified three general regimes in which prioritizing adults aged 20 to 49 years would provide greater mortality benefits than would prioritizing older adults. One such regime was in the presence of substantial transmission-mitigating interventions (R0 = 1.15) and a vaccine with 80% or higher transmission-blocking effects. A second regime was characterized by substantial transmission-mitigating interventions (R0 = 1.15) and either rollout speeds of at most 0.2% per day or vaccine supplies of at most 25% of the population. The third regime was characterized by vaccines with very low efficacy in older adults, very high efficacy in younger adults, and declines in efficacy starting at age 59 or 69 years. The advantage of prioritizing all adults or adults aged 20 to 49 versus 60+ years was small under these conditions. Thus, we conclude that for mortality reduction, prioritization of older adults is a robust strategy that will be optimal or close to optimal to minimize mortality for virtually all plausible vaccine characteristics.By contrast, the ranking of infection-minimizing strategies for midepidemic vaccination led to consistent recommendations to prioritize adults aged 20 to 49 years across efficacy values and countries. For pretransmission vaccination, prioritization shifted toward children and teenagers for leaky vaccine efficacies 50% and below, which is in line with prior work (7), as well as for vaccines with weak transmission-blocking properties. Because a vaccine is likely to have properties of both leaky and all-or-nothing models, empirical data on vaccine performance could help resolve this difference in model recommendations, although data are difficult to obtain in practice [for example, (33, 34)].It is not yet clear whether the first generation of COVID-19 vaccines will be approved everywhere for the elderly or those under 18 years of age (35‚Äì37). Although our conclusions assumed that the vaccine would be approved for all age groups, the evaluation approaches introduced here can be tailored to evaluate a subset of approaches restricted to those within the age groups for which a vaccine is licensed, by using open-source tools such as those that accompany this study. Furthermore, although we considered three possible goals of vaccination‚Äîminimizing cumulative incidence, mortality, or YLL‚Äîour framework can be adapted to consider goals such as minimizing hospitalizations, intensive care unit occupancy (7), or economic costs (10).We demonstrated that there is value in pairing individual-level serological tests with vaccination, even when accounting for the uncertainties in seroprevalence estimates (32) and seroreversion (30). The marginal gain in effective vaccine supply, relative to no serological testing, must be weighed against the challenges of serological testing before vaccination. Serostatus itself is an imperfect indicator of protection, and the relationship of prior infection, serostatus, and protection may change over time (10, 27, 30, 31). Delays in serological test results would impair vaccine distribution, but partial seronegative-targeting effects might be realized if those with past polymerase chain reaction (PCR)‚Äìconfirmed infections voluntarily deprioritized their own vaccinations.The best-performing strategies depend on assumptions about the extent of a population‚Äôs interactions. We used prepandemic contact matrices (38), reflecting the goal of a return to prepandemic routines once a vaccine is available, but more recent estimates of age-stratified contact rates could be valuable in modeling midpandemic scenarios (39, 40). Whether prepandemic or midpandemic contact estimates are representative of contact patterns during vaccine rollout remains unknown and may vary on the basis of numerous social, political, and other factors. The scenarios modeled here did not incorporate explicit nonpharmaceutical interventions, which might persist if vaccination coverage is incomplete, but are implicitly represented in scenario 1 (R0 = 1.15).Our study relies on estimates of other epidemiological parameters. In local contexts, these include age-structured seroprevalence and IFR, which vary by population (19, 20, 41). Globally, key parameters include the degree to which antibodies protect against reinfection or severity of disease and relative infectiousness by age. From vaccine trials, we also need evidence of efficacy in groups vulnerable to severe outcomes, including the elderly. Additionally, it will be critical to measure whether a vaccine that protects against symptomatic disease also blocks infection and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (42).The role of children during this pandemic has been unclear. Under our assumptions about susceptibility by age, children are not the major drivers of transmission in communities, which is consistent with emerging evidence (12). Thus, our results differ from the optimal distribution for influenza vaccines, which prioritize school-age children and adults aged 30 to 39 years (5). However, the relative susceptibility and infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 by age remain uncertain. Although it is unlikely that susceptibility to infection conditional on exposure is constant across age groups (12), we ran our model to test the sensitivity of this parameter. Under the scenario of constant susceptibility by age, vaccinating those under 20 years of age has a greater impact on reducing cumulative cases than vaccinating those aged 20 to 49 years (figs. S14 and 15).Our study is subject to a number of limitations. First, our evaluation strategy focuses on a single country at a time, rather than on between-population allocation (43). Second, we only consider variation in disease severity by age. However, other factors correlate with disease outcomes, such as treatment and health care access and comorbidities, which may correlate with factors such as rural versus urban location, socioeconomic status, sex (44, 45), and race and ethnicity (46), which are not accounted for in this study. Inclusion of these factors in a model would be possible, but only with statistically sound measurements of their stratified infection risk, contact rates, and disease outcomes. Even in the case of age stratification, contact surveys have typically not surveyed those 80 years and older, yet it is this population that suffers dramatically more severe COVID-19 disease and higher infection fatality rates. We extrapolated contact matrices to those older than 80, but direct measurements would be superior. Last, our study focused on guiding strategy rather than providing more detailed forecasting or estimates (10). As such, we have not made detailed parameter fits to time series of cases or deaths but rather have used epidemiologic models to identify robust strategies across a range of transmission scenarios.Our study also considers variation in disease risk only by age, through age-structured contact matrices and age-specific susceptibility, whereas many discussions around COVID-19 vaccine distribution have thus far focused on prioritizing health care or essential workers (47, 48). Contact rates, and thus infection potential, vary greatly not only by occupation and age but also by living arrangement (such as congregate settings or dormitories), neighborhood and mobility (49‚Äì52), and whether the population has a coordinated and fundamentally effective policy to control the virus. With a better understanding of population structure during the pandemic, and risk factors of COVID-19, these limitations could be addressed. Meanwhile, the robust findings in favor of prioritizing those age groups with the highest IFR to minimize mortality could potentially be extended to prioritize those with comorbidities that predispose them to a high IFR because the strategy of prioritizing the older age groups depends on direct rather than indirect protection.Vaccine prioritization is not solely a question of science but a question of ethics as well. Hallmarks of the COVID-19 pandemic, as with other global diseases, are inequalities and disparities. Although these modeling efforts focus on age and minimizing incidence and death within a simply structured population, other considerations are crucial, from equity in allocation between countries to disparities in access to health care, including vaccination, that vary by neighborhood. Thus, the model‚Äôs simplistic representation of vulnerability (age) should be augmented by better information on the correlates of infection risk and severity. Fair vaccine prioritization should avoid further harming disadvantaged populations. We suggest that after distribution, pairing serological testing with vaccination in the hardest-hit populations is one possible equitable way to extend the benefits of vaccination in settings where vaccination might otherwise not be deemed cost effective.Supplementary Materialsscience.sciencemag.org/content/371/6532/916/suppl/DC1Materials and MethodsSupplementary TextFigs.

      "The Immune System‚ÄîThe Body‚Äôs Defense Against Infection\n",
      "To understand how COVID-19 vaccines work, it helps to first look at how our bodies fight illness. When germs, such as the virus that causes COVID-19, invade our bodies, they attack and multiply. This invasion, called an infection, is what causes illness. Our immune system uses several tools to fight infection. Blood contains red cells, which carry oxygen to tissues and organs, and white or immune cells, which fight infection. Different types of white blood cells fight infection in different ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "Macrophages¬†are white blood cells that swallow up and digest germs and dead or dying cells. The macrophages leave behind parts of the invading germs called antigens. The body identifies antigens as dangerous and stimulates antibodies to attack them.\n",
      "B-lymphocytes¬†are defensive white blood cells. They produce antibodies that attack the pieces of the virus left behind by the macrophages.\n",
      "T-lymphocytes¬†are another type of defensive white blood cell. They attack cells in the body that have already been infected.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first time a person is infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, it can take several days or weeks for their body to make and use all the germ-fighting tools needed to get over the infection. After the infection, the person‚Äôs immune system remembers what it learned about how to protect the body against that disease.\n",
      "The body keeps a few T-lymphocytes, called memory cells, that go into action quickly if the body encounters the same virus again. When the familiar antigens are detected, B-lymphocytes produce antibodies to attack them. Experts are still learning how long these memory cells protect a person against the virus that causes COVID-19.\n",
      "How COVID-19 Vaccines Work\n",
      "COVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness. Different types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection, but with all types of vaccines, the body is left with a supply of ‚Äúmemory‚Äù T-lymphocytes as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus in the future.\n",
      "It typically takes a few weeks for the body to produce T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes after vaccination. Therefore, it is possible that a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and then get sick because the vaccine did not have enough time to provide protection.\n",
      "Sometimes after vaccination, the process of building immunity can cause symptoms, such as fever. These symptoms are normal and are a sign that the body is building immunity.\n",
      "Types of Vaccines\n",
      "Currently, there are three main types of COVID-19 vaccines that are or soon will be undergoing large-scale (Phase 3) clinical trials in the United States. Below is a description of how each type of vaccine prompts our bodies to recognize and protect us from the virus that causes COVID-19. None of these vaccines can give you COVID-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "mRNA vaccines contain material from the virus that causes COVID-19 that gives our cells instructions for how to make a harmless protein that is unique to the virus. After our cells make copies of the protein, they destroy the genetic material from the vaccine. Our bodies recognize that the protein should not be there and build T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight the virus that causes COVID-19 if we are infected in the future.\n",
      "Protein subunit vaccines include harmless pieces (proteins) of the virus that cause COVID-19 instead of the entire germ. Once vaccinated, our immune system recognizes that the proteins don‚Äôt belong in the body and begins making T-lymphocytes and¬†antibodies. If we are ever infected in the future, memory cells will recognize and fight the virus.\n",
      "Vector vaccines contain a weakened version of a live virus‚Äîa different virus than the one that causes COVID-19‚Äîthat has genetic material from the virus that causes COVID-19 inserted in it (this is called a viral vector). Once the viral vector is inside our cells, the genetic material gives cells instructions to make a protein that is unique to the virus that causes COVID-19. Using these instructions, our cells make copies of the protein. This prompts our bodies to build T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus if we are infected in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most COVID-19 Vaccines Require More Than One Shot\n",
      "All but one of the COVID-19 vaccines that are currently in Phase 3 clinical trials in the United States use two shots. The first shot starts building protection. A second shot a few weeks later is needed to get the most protection the vaccine has to offer. One vaccine in Phase 3 clinical trials only needs one shot.\n",
      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "Getting vaccinated is one of many steps you can take to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. ¬†Protection from COVID-19 is critically important because for some people, it can cause severe illness or death.\n",
      "Stopping a pandemic requires using all the tools available. Vaccines work with your immune system so your body will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed. Other steps, like masks and social distancing, help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others. Together, COVID-19 vaccination and following CDC‚Äôs recommendations to protect yourself and others will offer the best protection from COVID-19.\n",

    "1. In the real system, we need a reasoning engine. When the user type question with a human linguistic format sentence into the system, the reasoning engine can extract the core information (Here we need NLP technology). For example, in a sentence with different tenses, thesaurus but the same meaning, the engine can recognize it and extract the same core information. \n",

    "3. Moreover, a more advanced reasoning engine could deduce the answer according to the existing knowledge graph ( This may use the knowledge of machine learning but I haven't learnt that ). "
